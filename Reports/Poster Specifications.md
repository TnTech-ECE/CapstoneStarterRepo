## Poster size expectations

The poster should be 42 by 24. 

## Power point instructions

The college of engineering has poster templates available via the library website. However, the posters are not sized appropriately for the departments expectations. Be sure to resize the poster in power point in the following manner.

1. Choose “DESIGN”
2. Choose “Slide Size”
3. Choose “Custom Slide Size”
4. Choose “Widescreen”
5. Width: 42”
6. Height: 24”
7. Slide Orientation: “Landscape”
8. Design your poster
9. Save your slide as a PDF (within PowerPoint)

Be sure to also include a minimum of 2cm of border around the outside of the poster.

## Overleaf/Latex instructions

You may instead choose to use overleaf to make the poster. A template is included [here](https://github.com/TnTech-ECE/CapstoneStarterRepo/tree/main/Reports/Poster%20Template). Upload this template to overleaf and customize as necessary. The template is already the appropriate size.

## What to include in the poster

The poster should capture your entire project. At a minimum that would include:

1. The problem 
2. Necessary constraints (things that an observer needs to know - not every detail)
3. The solution (show off your design and artifacts)
4. The most relevant or interesting analysis results from the signoffs
5. The most relevant experimental results regarding your solutions success (in an appropriate format ie. graph, table, or figure) - do not include every detail
6. Pictures of the system are good to include
7. Cad models are good to include
8. Budgets are good to include
9. Team pictures are good to include

Each team has the opportunity to put their own identity into the poster and it will hang in the hall for a year. So, be sure to represent yourselves well. Remember to look at past posters for ideas about what to include and how to style the poster.

## What not to do

1. Don't leave too much open white space. Use the poster's space to tell the story of your project.
2. Don't make the text too small to read. The poster should be legible from 5 feet away.
3. Don't make images unnecessarily large. But do make them appropriately large so that they all text is legible.
4. Don't submit the poster without revising it. Mistakes are going to happen.
