# Final Report

Your final report should comprehensively capture the technical aspects of your designâ€”including identification, formulation, conceptual design, detailed design, analysis, implementation, and validation. The report should provide sufficient detail so that if another team were to read this document, they would be able to understand your design decisions and contribute additional improvements.

## Recomended Report Content

- Implementation (include pictures of what you built)
- Experimentation and validation (How well did you meet the measures of success?)
