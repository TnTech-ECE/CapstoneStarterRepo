# Design Presentation

Your design presentation is an opportunity to summarize your design work and present it to your management and customers. This presentation should encapsulate the key technical aspects of your design process—including identification, formulation, conceptual design, detailed design, and analysis. Focus on highlighting the most salient and impactful elements of your project. The aim is to deliver a compelling and engaging narrative that conveys the necessary technical information while omitting obvious or extraneous details.

Given the professional nature of your audience, it is imperative to uphold the highest standards of professionalism throughout your presentation. However, infusing appropriate humor and creativity can significantly enhance engagement and make your presentation memorable. We encourage each team to express their unique personalities and creativity, provided they maintain a professional demeanor. Remember, there is no singular "right" way to deliver this presentation—innovative approaches are welcome.
