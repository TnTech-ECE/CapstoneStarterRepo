# Individual Presentation

The purpose of the individual presentation is to provide students with practice in public speaking. Effective communication is crucial to success in the industry. Each team member is responsible for effectively communicating their challenges and insights to others.

To give students practice, each student is required to deliver a 5 to 10 minute presentation. Other students and the instructor will evaluate the student's performance. The presentation should focus on a technical issue of interest to the student. The topic may or may not be related to the student's detailed design but should be something in the electrical engineering area.

Each engineer should reflect on the following questions:
- What background information is necessary to understand the problem (assuming basic engineering knowledge)?
- How does this problem fit within the broader context of your field or industry?
- Why is this technical issue challenging or difficult to solve?
- Are there specific technical requirements or constraints that might not be immediately apparent?
- What solutions or approaches have been attempted to address the problem so far?
- Have these solutions been successful? Why or why not?
- Provide examples of where the solution is used in the real world, or how it could be utilized if developed.
- What impact has the solution made or could it make on the world?
- What ethical, environmental, or societal considerations are associated with this problem and its potential solutions?
- What future developments or research could further address this problem?
- What lessons have you learned from studying this problem, and how can these insights help you solve other problems in the future?

The presenter should strive to:
- Present content clearly and ensure it is suitable for the audience.
- Organize key objectives or main topics logically.
- Maintain audience engagement with eye contact and appropriate gestures throughout the presentation.
- Manage audience questions and interactions effectively.
- Dress in a professional manner that is appropriate for the presentation.
- Cite sources and provide references when needed to support points.
