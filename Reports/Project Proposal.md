# Project Proposal

This document provides a comprehensive explanation of what a project proposal should encompass. The content here is detailed and is intended to highlight the guiding principles rather than merely listing expectations. The sections that follow contain all the necessary information to understand the requirements for creating a project proposal.


## Required Format and Style

All submissions must be composed in markdown. Please refrain from submitting PDFs or Word documents.

### Citations

All sources used in the project proposal that are not common knowledge must be cited. Citations are crucial for distinguishing team opinions from substantiated facts.

### Writing Point of View

A professional tone is best achieved in third-person writing. However, there are situations where deviating from third person improves clarity and readability.

Examples:
- Acceptable: Each team should primarily write in third person unless one finds oneself in a situation better suited to first person.
- Better: Each team should primarily write in third person unless you find yourself in a situation better suited to first person.
- Ideal: Each team should primarily write in third person unless a specific situation is clearly better suited to first person.


## General Outline

### The Introduction

The introduction must be the opening section of the proposal. It acts as the "elevator pitch" of the project, briefly introducing the objective, its importance, and the proposed solution. Because readers may only read this section, it should effectively capture their attention and encourage them to read further.

Toward the end of the introduction, include a subsection that outlines what the proposal will cover. This helps set reader expectations for the ensuing sections.


### Formulating the Problem

Formulating the problem or objective involves clearly defining it through background information, specifications, and constraints. Think of it as "fencing in" the objective to make it unambiguously clear what is and is not being addressed and why.

Questions to consider:
-Who does the problem affect?
-Why do we need this solution?
-What challenges necessitate a dedicated, multi-person engineering project?
-Why aren’t off-the-shelf solutions sufficient?

#### Background

Provide context and details necessary to define the problem clearly and delineate its boundaries.

#### Signifcance

Explain the implications of solving the problem for the customer. After reading this section, the reader should understand the tangible benefits and the worthiness of the proposed work.

#### Specifications and Constraints

Specifications and constraints define the system's requirements. They can be positive (do this) or negative (don't do that). They can be mandatory (shall or must) or optional (may). They can cover performance, accuracy, interfaces, or limitations. Regardless of their origin, they must be unambiguous and impose measurable requirements.

##### Specifications

Specifications are requirements imposed by **stakeholders** to meet their needs. If a specification seems unattainable, it is necessary to discuss and negotiate with the stakeholders.

##### Constraints

Constraints often stem from governing bodies, standards organizations, and broader considerations beyond the requirements set by stakeholders.

Questions to consider:
-Do governing bodies regulate the solution in any way?
-Are there industrial standards that need to be considered and followed?
-What impact will the engineering, manufacturing, or final product have on public health, safety, and welfare?
-Are there global, cultural, social, environmental, or economic factors that must be considered?


### Survey of Existing Solutions

Research existing solutions, whether in literature, on the market, or within the industry. Present these findings in a coherent, organized manner. Remember to cite all information that is not common knowledge.


### The Measures of Success

Define how the project’s success will be measured. This involves explaining the experiments and methodologies to verify that the system meets its specifications and constraints.


### The Resources

Each project proposal must include a comprehensive description of the necessary resources.

#### Budget

Provide a budget proposal with justifications for expenses such as software, equipment, components, testing machinery, and prototyping costs. This should be an estimate, not a detailed bill of materials.

#### Personnel

Identify the skills present in the team and compare them to those required to complete the project. Address any skill gaps with a plan to acquire the necessary knowledge.

#### Timeline

Provide a detailed timeline, including all major deadlines and tasks. This should be illustrated with a professional Gantt chart.


### Broader Implications, Ethics, and Responsibility as Engineers

Consider the project’s broader impacts in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts. Identify potential negative impacts and propose mitigation strategies. Detail the ethical considerations and responsibilities each team member bears as an engineer.


### Statement of Contributions

Each team member must contribute meaningfully to the project proposal. Clearly document each member's contributions at the end of the document.
