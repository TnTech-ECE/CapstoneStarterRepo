# Lessons Learned

This document should have a section for each team member. Each engineer should respond to these:

- Reflect on the project, both technical and organizational. What went well? What didn’t go well? 
- What unanticipated problems occurred? 
- What would you do differently if you were to do it over again? 
- What “best practices” have you identified? 
- What words of wisdom would you pass on to future students?
- What new knowledge or skills did you acquire throughout capstone.

Create a subsection addressing each of the above questions in your section of the document.

1. The project went well technically and orginizationally over all, but there were a few issues. Orginizationally the electrical and mechanical sides of the project did not start effectively communicating until the second semster of capstone, and this put us at a disadvantage with design because we were lacking their input during the fall semester. Technically the project had to change a lot due to rule changes made by the competition at the last minute, and when at the competition the practice boards were all different.
2. There were a few unanticipated problems. The first being that our navigation sensor was scraping on the ground during the inclines due to the hieght requirements for it to work, this was solved by changing how the wheelie bars dropped that it was attached to. The second problem was that when we got to the competition, several rules changed, and we had not tested the robot crawling over the boxes, which really messed up or systems at first. Thirdly the team spirit system was too heavy for the robot and would cause it to tip over when installed. Lastly and most unanticipated was that the motors turned into generators on the downhill portions of the track, which elevated the ground plane and caused our microcontroller to brown out and reset the code.
3. If I were to do this over again, I would start communicating with the mechanicals from day 1, and have made all of our meetings mandatory for everyone instead of having one mechanical at the electrical meetings. I also would have checked the rules more regularly to be able to see the changes they made because the competition would update the rules and not announce it to anyone. I would have designed the power system to be more robust against the ground plane shifting instead of jury rigging a 9 volt battery to the microcontroller at the competition. Lastly I would have started all th edetail designs a week earlier to get them all signed off to have more time to build the robot.
4. It is best to involve the whole team in major discussions. It is also best to apply everyone to areas of strengths, and try and overlap strength sof one person with the weaknesses of others.
5. I have identified several things as best practices. The first being to ask everyone on the team for input, not just the electrical or the mechanicals. Secondly, if you are not sure how to do something, ask someone, because this is not a solo project. Ask the mechanicals, as they have great ideas. Design a point of failure, because if you do not, the universe will assign one for you, and it will not be where you like.
6. I acquired several new skills during capstone. I learned a lot about arduino coding in C. I also learned about torque calculations, and how to do motor sims in simulink.
