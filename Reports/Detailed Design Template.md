# Detailed Design

This document outlines the objectives of a detailed design. After reading your detailed design, the reader should understand:

- How the subsystem fits into the overall solution
- The constraints and specifications applicable to the subsystem
- Why each critical design decision is theoretically sound
- How to build the solution


## General Requirements for the Document

The document should include:

- Description of how the subsystem integrates with the overall solution
- Detailed specifications and constraints applicable to the subsystem
- Overview of the proposed solution
- 3D models of custom mechanical components*
- Buildable schematics*
- Printed Circuit Board (PCB) layout*
- Operational flow charts*
- Complete Bill of Materials (BOM)*
- Analysis of critical design decisions
- Implementation plan that considers team skills and time requirements

*Note: Technical documentation items are only required where relevant to the specific subsystem.


## Function of the Subsystem

This section should clearly explain what role the subsystem will play within the whole system. It should describe what the subsystem is expected to do (ie. its atomic purpose from the conceptual design).


## Specifications And Constraints

This section should contain the constraints for the subsystem. The reasoning behind the constraints must be given. As a few examples, constraints may exist due to physics based limitations or requirements, other subsystem requirements, standards, ethics, or socioeconomic reasons. 

The team should give specification for each subsystem. Some of the specifications may need to be changed. The whole team must approve specification changes. It might be nessasary to add contraints as additional information is discovered.

Also state what inputs, output and data will be pass to other subsystems.

Each subsystem must have at least one constraint arising from standards, ethics, or socioeconomic well being.


## Overview of the proposed solution

Desribe your solution and how it will meet the specification and constraints for this subsystem.



## 3D model of custom mechanical componatents

If the device has mechanical component Show several views of the 3D model needed to build the device. Embedded in the markdown file as a jpeg image. Make sure the image is clearly readable and appropriately sized.


## Buildable schematic 

The third section should show the buildable schematic directly embedded in the markdown file as a jpeg image. If the schematic is not clearly readable and appropriately sized, the supervisor will reject the signoff. 

The schematic must be appropriate to the design. ie. 3d model for a physical system or wiring schematic for a circuit. Further, the schematic(s) must contain every detail necessary for the design to be built by someone who has no knowledge of the design. Every relevant component value and measurement must be given.


## Printed circuit board layout

Provide a printed circuit board layout that is ready to be manufactored.


## Flow chart of the operation

For subsections that have a software component, a provided a chart that show how the subsystem operate. This does not have to show exalstive detail, only that the student has put effort into considering how the device will function.


## BOM

A complete list of all components needed for the design must be given with the cost of each component and the total cost of the subsystem. The BOM should be a markdown table. Make to to provide the manufacteror, part number, distributor, distributor part number, and price. Also provide a url where the product can be purchased from.


## Analysis

A complete and relevant analysis of the design showing that it **should** meet the constraints and perform the desired function must be given. This analysis must be comprehensive and well explained so that it is convincing.


## References

All sources utilized in the conceptual design that are not considered common knowledge must be properly cited. Multiple references should be included.
