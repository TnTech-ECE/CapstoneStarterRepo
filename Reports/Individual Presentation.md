# Individual Presentation

The purpose of the individual presentation is to provide students with practice in public speaking. Effective communication is crucial to success in the industry. Each team member is responsible for effectively communicating their challenges & insights to others.

To give students practice, each student is required to deliver a 5-10-minute presentation. Other students and the instructor will evaluate the student's performance. The presentation should focus on the lessons the student has learned during the course of the capstone project. These lessons could be related to technical skills or soft skills.

Each engineer should address the following points:
- Reflect on the project from both a technical and organizational perspective. What went well? What didnâ€™t go well?
- What unanticipated problems arose, and how did you address them?
- If you could redo the project, what would you do differently?
- What "best practices" have you identified that could be applied to future projects?
- What advice or words of wisdom would you offer to future students embarking on similar projects?
- What new knowledge or skills did you acquire throughout the capstone?
- How have these newly acquired skills or insights influenced your approach to engineering or your career aspirations?
- Provide specific examples or case studies from the project to illustrate the lessons learned.
- Discuss the impact of collaboration and teamwork on your project and the role you played.

The presentor should strive to:
- Present content clearly and ensure it is suitable for the audience.
- Organize key objectives or main topics logically.
- Maintain audience engagement with eye contact and appropriate gestures throughout the presentation.
- Manage audience questions and interactions effectively.
- Dress in a professional manner that is appropriate for the presentation.
