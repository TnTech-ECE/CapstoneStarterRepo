## Introduction

As chess continues to grow in popularity, the demand for new, more interesting chess technology has become increasingly apparent. One of the newest innovations made to meet this demand is the automated chess board. Automated chess boards are capable of moving each piece around the board without human intervention, allowing users to play over the board against computers, people with disabilities, and friends across the world. Although this advancement has provided many new and exciting opportunities in the world of chess, automated boards prove to be too expensive for widespread use by average consumers. This project aims to design an automated chess board at a cheaper price, providing its benefits to more people around the world.

#TODO: HELP!!!

By allowing the autonomous movement of pieces upon receiving a spoken command at a cheaper price, this product will allow a larger audience to enjoy the experience and impact of automated chess boards.


The introduction must be the opening section of the proposal. It acts as the "elevator pitch" of the project, briefly introducing the objective, its importance, and the proposed solution. Because readers may only read this section, it should effectively capture their attention and encourage them to read further.

Toward the end of the introduction, include a subsection that outlines what the proposal will cover. This helps set reader expectations for the ensuing sections.


## Formulating the Problem

Current automated chess boards are expensive and lack features such as online functionality, voice recognition, and unobstructed movement. The goal of this implementation is to improve these features, reduce cost, use accessible parts for easy hobbyist replication, and to make the game more accessible for players with disabilities. Beyond individual use, this new technology could attract new customers to businesses related to board games or leisure locations through its novelty and fascination. Challenges of this project include digital signal processing for voice controls, artificial intelligence (AI) implementation for solo-play, and automating piece movement. 

### Background

During the pandemic, chess increased in popularity [5]. Online chess specifically had a major influx of activity, with Chess.com adding 1 million accounts from March to November 2020, and a 2.8 million member increase in November alone [5]. This newfound popularity opens up opportunities for innovation on this classic game. An automated chess board would support primarily online chess players who want to improve their over-the-board (OTB) game.

AI has had a major impact in the world of chess, especially in the context of online play [6]. It provides learning opportunities, as certain AI can beat any human player. Chess games played OTB do not usually have this capability except for automated boards. AI in OTB implementations will allow players to improve by progressively increasing the strength of their opponent. This function would aid online players transitioning to OTB play, as they could play against AI before a human opponent. This feature also supports those who want to play OTB chess but cannot do so alone.

Many efforts have been made to ensure that chess tournaments are accommodating to those with disabilities [7]. These accommodations still could be improved upon for player autonomy and ease in preparing. For those with Alzheimer’s, other dementias, dyslexia, dysgraphia, fine/gross motor needs, who are blind, or those with a temporary disability such as a broken hand, an accommodation that can be made is the assignment of a Game Assistant (GA) [7]. In cases such as these, the GA may be needed for piece movement, clock pressing, and/or scoring [7]. An automated board could help as an alternative to a GA by helping with piece movement, automatically keeping time, and automating scoring. This would allow players more independence, as they would not have to rely on the assistance of a GA, and fewer volunteers would be needed for tournaments.


## Survey of Existing Solutions

Existing solutions for automated chessboards range from DIY projects to commercially-produced boards:

* **DIY Solutions**: Several open-source projects present designs of varying complexity. Some rely on stepper motors and Arduinos for piece movement, while others incorporate Raspberry Pis and computer vision to track pieces and issue precise directions via microcontrollers.
* **Industrial Solutions**: Several companies offer high-end automated boards with AI opponents and online connectivity. These solutions, however, are often too expensive for the average user, making them impractical for this application.
