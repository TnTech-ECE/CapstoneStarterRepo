## Introduction

As chess continues to grow in popularity, the demand for new, more interesting chess technology has become increasingly apparent. One of the newest innovations made to meet this demand is the automated chess board. Automated chess boards are capable of moving each piece around the board without human intervention, allowing users to play over the board against computers, people with disabilities, and friends across the world. Although this advancement has provided many new and exciting opportunities in the world of chess, automated boards prove to be too expensive for widespread use by average consumers. This project aims to design an automated chess board at a cheaper price, providing its benefits to more people around the world.

#TODO: HELP!!!

By allowing the autonomous movement of pieces upon receiving a spoken command at a cheaper price, this product will allow a larger audience to enjoy the experience and impact of automated chess boards.


The introduction must be the opening section of the proposal. It acts as the "elevator pitch" of the project, briefly introducing the objective, its importance, and the proposed solution. Because readers may only read this section, it should effectively capture their attention and encourage them to read further.

Toward the end of the introduction, include a subsection that outlines what the proposal will cover. This helps set reader expectations for the ensuing sections.


## Formulating the Problem

Current automated chess boards are expensive and lack features such as online functionality, voice recognition, and unobstructed movement. The goal of this implementation is to improve these features, reduce cost, use accessible parts for easy hobbyist replication, and to make the game more accessible for players with disabilities. Beyond individual use, this new technology could attract new customers to businesses related to board games or leisure locations through its novelty and fascination. Challenges of this project include digital signal processing for voice controls, artificial intelligence (AI) implementation for solo-play, and automating piece movement. 

### Background

During the pandemic, chess increased in popularity [5]. Online chess specifically had a major influx of activity, with Chess.com adding 1 million accounts from March to November 2020, and a 2.8 million member increase in November alone [5]. This newfound popularity opens up opportunities for innovation on this classic game. An automated chess board would support primarily online chess players who want to improve their on-the-board (OTB) game.

AI has had a major impact in the world of chess, especially in the context of online play [6]. It provides learning opportunities, as certain AI can beat any human player. Chess games played OTB do not usually have this capability except for automated boards. AI in OTB implementations will allow players to improve by progressively increasing the strength of their opponent. This function would aid online players transitioning to OTB play, as they could play against AI before a human opponent. This feature also supports those who want to play OTB chess but cannot do so alone.

Many efforts have been made to ensure that chess tournaments are accommodating to those with disabilities [7]. These accommodations still could be improved upon for player autonomy and ease in preparing. For those with Alzheimer’s, other dementias, dyslexia, dysgraphia, fine/gross motor needs, who are blind, or those with a temporary disability such as a broken hand, an accommodation that can be made is the assignment of a Game Assistant (GA) [7]. In cases such as these, the GA may be needed for piece movement, clock pressing, and/or scoring [7]. An automated board could help as an alternative to a GA by helping with piece movement, automatically keeping time, and automating scoring. This would allow players more independence, as they would not have to rely on the assistance of a GA, and fewer volunteers would be needed for tournaments.

In recent years, the rise of board game cafés has demonstrated the strong appeal of face-to-face interaction and social gaming [8]. An automated chessboard with a visually engaging design could build on this trend by drawing curiosity and encouraging participation. Its novelty and interactive features would provide a memorable experience for customers, enhancing the atmosphere of businesses and leisure spaces that adopt the technology.

One of the major ways a technology can become widespread is through low cost and easy manufacturability. The current automated chess boards available on the market are often prohibitively expensive for the average consumer [1][2][3][4]. By focusing on affordability and providing open documentation, this project lowers barriers for hobbyists and educators who wish to replicate or modify the design. Reduced costs also make it possible to introduce the technology to a wider audience, including students and lifelong learners, while still preserving the appeal of a physical, interactive product.


### Specifications and Constraints

Specifications and constraints define the system's requirements. They can be positive (do this) or negative (don't do that). They can be mandatory (shall or must) or optional (may). They can cover performance, accuracy, interfaces, or limitations. Regardless of their origin, they must be unambiguous and impose measurable requirements.

#### Specifications

Specifications are requirements imposed by **stakeholders** to meet their needs. If a specification seems unattainable, it is necessary to discuss and negotiate with the stakeholders.

#### Constraints

Constraints often stem from governing bodies, standards organizations, and broader considerations beyond the requirements set by stakeholders.

Questions to consider:
- Do governing bodies regulate the solution in any way?
- Are there industrial standards that need to be considered and followed?
- What impact will the engineering, manufacturing, or final product have on public health, safety, and welfare?
- Are there global, cultural, social, environmental, or economic factors that must be considered?


## Survey of Existing Solutions

Research existing solutions, whether in literature, on the market, or within the industry. Present these findings in a coherent, organized manner. Remember to cite all information that is not common knowledge.


## Measures of Success

Define how the project’s success will be measured. This involves explaining the experiments and methodologies to verify that the system meets its specifications and constraints.


## Resources

Each project proposal must include a comprehensive description of the necessary resources.

### Budget

Provide a budget proposal with justifications for expenses such as software, equipment, components, testing machinery, and prototyping costs. This should be an estimate, not a detailed bill of materials.

### Personel

Identify the skills present in the team and compare them to those required to complete the project. Address any skill gaps with a plan to acquire the necessary knowledge.

Besides the team, also state who you choose to be you supervisor and why.

State who your instrucotr is and what role you expect them to play in the project.

### Timeline

Provide a detailed timeline, including all major deadlines and tasks. This should be illustrated with a professional Gantt chart.


## Specific Implications

Explain the implications of solving the problem for the customer. After reading this section, the reader should understand the tangible benefits and the worthiness of the proposed work.


## Broader Implications, Ethics, and Responsibility as Engineers

Consider the project’s broader impacts in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts. Identify potential negative impacts and propose mitigation strategies. Detail the ethical considerations and responsibilities each team member bears as an engineer.
