# Detailed Design

This document outlines the objectives of a detailed design. After reading your detailed design, the reader should understand:

- How the subsystem fits into the overall solution.
- The constraints and specifications applicable to the subsystem.
- Why each critical design decision is theoreticaly sound.
- How to build the product.


## General Requirements for the Document
- How the subsystem fits into the overall solution.
- The specifications and constraints applicable to the subsystem.
- An analysis of critical design decisions.
- An overview of the solution.
- A 3D model of custom mechanical componatents*.
- A buildable schematic*.
- A printed circuit board (PCB) layout*.
- Flow chart of the operation*.
- An complete bill of materials (BOM)*.
- Plan to build
*Note that these items are only requiered where needed


## Function of the Subsystem

You must explain clearly what role the subsystem will play in the first section. This should clearly explain what the system is expected to do (ie. its atomic purpose from the conceptual design).


## Specifications And Constraints

The second section should contain the constraints for the subsystem. The reasoning behind the constraints must be given. As a few examples, constraints may exist due to physics based limitations or requirements, other subsystem requirements, standards, ethics, or socioeconomic reasons. 

Each subsystem must have at least one constraint arising from standards, ethics, or socioeconomic well being.


## Analysis

A complete and relevant analysis of the design showing that it **should** meet the constraints and perform the desired function must be given. This analysis must be comprehensive and well explained so that it is convincing.


## 3D model of custom mechanical componatents


## Buildable schematic 

The third section should show the buildable schematic directly embedded in the markdown file as a jpeg image. If the schematic is not clearly readable and appropriately sized, the supervisor will reject the signoff. 

The schematic must be appropriate to the design. ie. 3d model for a physical system or wiring schematic for a circuit. Further, the schematic(s) must contain every detail necessary for the design to be built by someone who has no knowledge of the design. Every relevant component value and measurement must be given.

The actual design artifacts (3d model, Cad files, gerber files, etc) must be uploaded to the documentation folder in the appropriate location.

## 3D Model

## Printed circuit board layout

## Flow chart of the operation



## BOM

A complete list of all components needed for the design must be given with the cost of each component and the total cost of the subsystem. The BOM should be a markdown table. Make to to provide the manufacteror, part number, distributor, distributor part number, and price. Also provide a url where the product can be purchased from.


## References

All sources utilized in the conceptual design that are not considered common knowledge must be properly cited. Multiple references should be included.
