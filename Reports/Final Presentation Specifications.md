## Final Presentation

The final presentation should capture the technical aspects of the design (identification, formulation, conceptual design, deetail design, analysis, implementation, and validation) without attempting to include every detail exhaustively. Instead, the presentation should represent the things which were most salient about the project. 

The goal is to build a compelling and interesting presentation which includes the necessary technical information and excludes the obvious. 

### Things that should be in the presentation (amount of coverage - time, number of slides, and exhaustiveness - is up to the team)

1. The problem
2. Sufficient formulation of the problem
3. Standards and regulations
4. Some detail design, constraints, and analysis
5. Implementation (How did the build go? Were there interesting problems you overcame?)
6. Software (Did you write any novel, ambitious, or otherwise interesting software?)
7. Experimentation and Validation (How well did you meet the measures of success? This should be presented clearly and thoroughly with interpretation)
8. The budget
9. Demonstration (video or live demonstration of your project)

Teams should include some information throughout their presentation that allows the audience to understand the design process as it was followed by the team. 

Teams should include some information about how broader considerations relating to public health, safety, and welfare were considered. 

Teams should include some information about how broader considerations relating to global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors were considered.

### Creativity

This presentation is a representation of the team that did the project. Each team is encouraged to be creative and express their personalities while also maintaining high standards of professionalism. There is no one right way to make the presentation.
