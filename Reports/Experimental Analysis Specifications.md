# Experimental Analysis

The goal of experimental analysis is to systematically evaluate how well your project meets its critical specifications, constraints, and measures of success. This process consists of three main stages:

1. **Designing Experiments**
2. **Conducting Experiments**
3. **Analyzing Results and Drawing Conclusions**

After you are done with experimentation, write a report to document your findings.

## Designing Experiments

Start by revisiting your conceptual design and clearly identifying the most critical requirements and success criteria impacting your project's overall goals. Collaborate as a team to determine these critical aspects. It is recommended to obtain instructor approval to confirm that these identified criteria are appropriate and sufficient for thorough evaluation.

Clearly define the following aspects for each experiment:

- **Purpose**:

  - Clearly state the exact criteria you intend to measure.
  - Criteria should align directly with your project's critical requirements or detailed design objectives.
  - Consider the customer's viewpoint: what features or performance attributes are most important from their perspective?
  - Anticipate that your instructor may require additional criteria for comprehensive evaluation.

- **Procedure**:

  - Provide detailed, step-by-step instructions outlining how the experiment will be conducted.
  - Include specifics such as required equipment, environmental conditions, and preparation steps.
  - Procedures should be detailed enough to ensure repeatability and clarity.

- **Data Collection**:

  - Identify exactly what data will be recorded during the experiment.
  - Clearly specify units, methods of measurement, and formats for recording.
  - Include how frequently data points should be taken and how they will be documented (e.g., in tables, spreadsheets, video recordings).

- **Trials**:

  - Determine and justify how many repetitions of each experiment are necessary.
  - Multiple trials (e.g., N ≥ 3) are highly recommended to ensure statistical significance and reliability.
  - Consider using multiple copies or prototypes of your device to facilitate efficient testing and improve the robustness of your data.

- **Potential Biases**:

  - Identify potential sources of bias or errors that may impact experimental results.
  - Develop clear strategies to mitigate or control these biases (e.g., randomized trials, controlled environments, calibration of instruments).



## Conducting Experiments

When carrying out experiments:

- Carefully adhere to the established experimental procedures.
- Conduct each trial consistently to ensure reliable and comparable results.
- Record all data accurately and methodically.
- Organize your data clearly, using appropriate formats such as tables, charts, or graphs for ease of analysis.



## Analyzing Results and Drawing Conclusions

After completing experiments:

- Thoroughly analyze all collected data, paying close attention to consistency and patterns.
- Evaluate your data to identify potential sources of error, bias, or abnormalities, and address their implications.
- Clearly articulate conclusions derived from the data, emphasizing evidence-based insights and interpretations.
- Identify correlations or suggest causal relationships, if supported by data.

If analysis uncovers questions or uncertainties, consider designing and executing additional targeted experiments to refine your understanding.



## Writing the Report

Your deliverable should be a comprehensive markdown document, clearly organized, and uploaded to your project's GitHub repository.



For each documented experiment, you must include:

1. **Purpose and Justification**:

   - Explain why the experiment was designed, and how it relates to your critical success criteria.

2. **Detailed Procedure**:

   - Outline clearly the methods used, ensuring another team could reproduce your experiment.

3. **Expected Results**:

   - State your initial hypothesis or expectations clearly before conducting experiments.

4. **Actual Results**:

   - Present data collected during the experiments in an organized, easy-to-interpret format (tables, graphs, charts).

5. **Interpretation and Conclusions**:

   - Provide a detailed analysis explaining the significance of the results.
   - State whether results matched your expectations and explain any discrepancies.



When you have complete all of the experiments: clearly summarize whether your experiments demonstrated that your project meets the original success criteria outlined in your conceptual design. If success criteria were not met, discuss the reasons and outline steps for improvement.



## Statement of Contributions

Each team member must contribute meaningfully to the experimental analysis and document their contributions clearly in this section. Contributions should be recorded individually, and one team member may not document contributions on behalf of another. Each team member must clearly outline their involvement in experiment design, execution, data analysis, and reporting. By submitting this report, the team collectively certifies the accuracy and completeness of each member's stated contributions.
