## Experimentation and Testing

In this document is contained the experimentation and testing of the robot, and an analysis of those results. 

### Start Sensor

The start sensor was tested 30 times, and the target success rate was 80%. The results of the tests along with the response time is recorded below.

| 30 | Yes | 0.92 |

As shown above, the start sensor worked 100% of the time, exceeding the required 80%. This also shows that the response time for the sensor was under 1 second, and was probably faster than the recorded time as the time was reliant on human reaction time.
