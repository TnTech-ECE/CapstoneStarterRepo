# SECON 2024 Hardware Competition Robot

## Executive Summary

This project aims to design and build an autonomous robot to compete in the 2024 IEEE Southeast Convention Student Hardware Competition. This robot shall navigate the course, demonstrate school spirit, and finally push a button to complete the run in under three minutes. This robot shall function to attain as many points as possible while minimizing risk to ensure a consistent score on each run and completion of the project before the competition’s start date. The strategy defined takes into account the difficulty of the competition’s tasks as well as the
abbreviated timeline of the team, to produce a realistic and attainable product. The robot shall perform specifically chosen tasks consistently, although it will not attempt all possible
tasks to minimize risk during both development and deployment.


## Capabilities

The project thus far demonstrates the planning and design phases of the engineering process. This includes the initial project proposal and budget, designs of subsystems, 3D renderings of the placement of the individual subsystems, bills of materials, and analysis of the designs produced.

## Salient Outcomes

There are no salient outcomes at this time. We hope to have more interesting outcomes when construction and implementation begin in 2024.


## Project Demonstration & Images
A video demonstration shall be included once the construction and implementation of the project are completed in 2024.

3D Renderings of the Project as designed thus far are included below.

Caz Bilbrey
I have been working for Merrick and Company for over 2 years. I plan to move to Oak Ridge Tennessee to continue my work in glovebox design. I am responsible for the design of the Start Sensor and Chassis. 

Liam Counasse
I am majoring in electrical engineering with a minor in mathematics. My interests include industrial automation design and programming for a variety of languages. I am responsible for the design of the Team Spirit System.

Adrin Jackson
I am an intern with TVA. Some hobbies of mine are hiking and golfing with my friends and exploring new restaurants. I am responsible for the design of the Button Push Mechanism, Drive Train, and Power System.

Conor Orr
I am involved in multiple campus organizations. I am a practical problem solver and love getting my hands dirty. I am responsible for the design of the Navigation System and Drive Train.

#### Mechanical Engineers

Colby Adams
I am a senior mechanical engineering major with a mechatronic concentration. Last summer I had an internship at JR Automation in Nashville working on the mechanical side of their projects.

James Howell
I am a ME major, concentrating in mechatronics. I'm a project lead for ARC, fronting the design of a custom 3d printer as well as facilitating the use of the club's working printers for its other projects.

Steve Jordan
I worked on an internship at Aisin Automotive Casting Tennessee last summer where I researched and presented an Industrial Parts Washer Station to save $36,000 yearly in short stops. I plan to move to Knoxville Tennessee to work in design/consulting.

Zachary Wisti
I am the president of the TTU Formula SAE team. I welcome challenges and like to face them head-on.

### Faculty Supervisor
