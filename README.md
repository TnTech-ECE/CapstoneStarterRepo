# Drone Tracking System
## Executive Summary

Drones have grown exceedingly popular in recent years due to both their novelty and capabilities. Unfortunately, not all drone users prioritize the safety and privacy of others while flying their drones, so to combat a rise in unsafe drone activities, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) created a regulation in 2023 requiring drones to emit a remote identification signal. Utilizing this regulation, this team is designing a drone tracking device that will notify the Tennessee Technological University (TTU) Police if an unauthorized drone enters the contiguous campus.
