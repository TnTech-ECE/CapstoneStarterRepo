## Executive Summary

Our team is tasked by Lockinvar to create an induction heater controller to [WE DO NOT KNOW THIS YET] regulate the power delivered to an induction heater. The purpose of this controller is to improve the energy efficiency and life expectancy of the heater. We plan to have safety systems in place to ensure that nothing gets overheated.

## Capabilities

[WE DO NOT KNOW THIS YET] Lochivar has a smart touch control system we might look at more. 

## Salient Outcomes

Our team expects to provide our customer with a ready-to-use design solution to the problem we were tasked with solving. The outcomes we expect to meet are provided as such below:

- Precision temperature and power control
- Optimization of efficiency for the heating system in regards to previous heating solutions
- Reliable protection and safety for the design
- Easy-to-use and user-friendly interface for technical support 

## Project Demonstration & Images

Give a link to a video of the project being demonstrated. The video should be hosted on the capstone youtube.

Below the video link show some well-taken, appropriately sized images of the project.
