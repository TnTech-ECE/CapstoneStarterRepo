# SECON 2024 Hardware Competition Robot

## Executive Summary

The goal of this project is to design and build an autonomous robot to compete in the 2024 IEEE Southeast Convention Student Hardware Competition. The theme od the competition is a rocket launch, and the course and objectives reflect this. The robot will navigate a course and collect and deposit objectrs in certain places in under a three minute time limit. The team consists of five electrical engineers and four mechanical engineers.
