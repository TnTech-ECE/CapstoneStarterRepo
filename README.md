# {Parking Lot Monitoring System: Ground Based Solution} - Your project should have a catchy and functional name

The descriptions and information in all readme files in the starter repo (including this one) must be edited. All section descriptions must be deleted. Any failure to remove the description information (like the statement that you are currently reading) will be heavily penalized!

## Executive Summary

Give the elevator pitch and abstract for the project. It should allow interested visitors to broadly understand the motivation for the project and what the project has accomplished.


## Capabilities

Here explain in more detail (though not as much as will be given in the datasheet) what the version of this project in this repo is capable of doing.


## Salient Outcomes

Projects often have some outcomes that are more interesting than others. Here, highlight those things that you found interesting!


## Project Demonstration & Images

Give a link to a video of the project being demonstrated. The video should be hosted on the capstone youtube.

Below the video link show some well-taken, appropriately sized images of the project.


## About Us

### Team

Abdulrahman Alrudayan is a senior Electrical Engineering major at Tennessee Technological University.  His interests include power systems and digital design.  The main focus for Abdulrahman is designing the main power system that will distribute power to the entire system through the use of buck converters, step down transformers, etc.

Khalifah Altamimi is a senior Electrical Engineering major at Tennessee Technological University.  His interests include power systems, robotics, and digital design.  The main focus for Khalifah is designing the backup power system that will provide power to allow the system to continue working when a power outage has occurred on campus.  When the system is not being used, it will be charging and stay charged until backup power is needed for the system.

Brady Beecham is a senior Computer Engineering major at Tennessee Technological University.  His interests include

Kyle Plant is a senior Computer Engineering major with a minor in Computer Science at Tennessee Technological University.  His interests include programming, FPGA, VLSI, networks, embedded systems, artificial intelligence, automation, and more. He has had three internships during his time as an undergraduate. The first two were at Matheson, a producer of industrial, medical, and specialty gasses as well as gas handling equipment. His first internship at Matheson involved making user-friendly GUI dashboards to display graphs of gas purity or mixture ratio data as well as many other small projects. His second internship at Matheson involved performing general site IT duties as well as a few small projects. His third internship was with QMSI or Quality Manufacturing Systems, Inc. QMSI is an automation and systems integration company that specializes in automated pharmacy systems. At QMSI he worked with AutoCAD to make drawings for the conveyor lines and motor panels. The main focus for Kyle is designing a system to collect data from the loop detector, transmit data to a central computer, and store this data in a database within the central computer. This will involve microcontroller programming, wireless networking, and database management.

Michael Sisk is a senior Electrical Engineering major at Tennessee Technological University.  His interests include power systems, robotics, and automation.  He has spent eight months interning at Jack Daniels Distillery in Lynchburg, TN as an engineering maintenance intern.  He is also currently serving as the Engineering Joint Council (EJC) Representative for the student chapter of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).  The main focus for Michael Sisk is designing the ground-based sensor, which involves using a series of inductive loops to detect the presence of vehicles and determining whether a vehicle is entering or exiting a parking lot from the information given from the loops.

### Stakeholders

The primary customer for this project is the Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division in Dahlgren, VA, that is under the command of the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA). 

One major stakeholder that will be affected by the project are commuter students.  Commuter students will use this system heavily as they must find parking in a timely manner in specific parking lots in order to be on time for class or extracurricular events on campus.

Another stakeholder that will be affected by the project are campus visitors.  For visitors that have come to Tennessee Tech University numerous times or for first time visitors, it will be extremely useful in locating parking lots that have availability to allow them more time to complete business they have on campus and not have to spend a significant amount of time finding places to park on campus.

Tell a bit about the customer for the project. Also discuss any other groups (specific or general) that are expected to be impacted by the project.

### Recognitions

Since this project is a continuation from the 2022-23 academic year, this team wants to recognize the previous Parking Lot Monitoring System team and their members: Kester Nucum, Aaron Wilhite, Gabriel Laboy, Genevieve Schreiber, and Reggie Garza.  This team consisted of three computer engineering students and two electrical engineering students.  With their knowledge and collaboration with the CSC team, they were successful in creating a server, sign, and cameras to detect and count the number of vehicles in a specified parking lot.  Due to their work, this team of three electrical engineering students and two computer engineering students was able to create a ground-based solution to assist the current camera system in detecting vehicles entering and leaving a parking lot and display an accurate number of available parking spots within a specific parking lot..

Use this space to recognize anyone that you feel has had an impact on the project. Be sure to recognize the work of previous teams if you referenced it for style or content.
