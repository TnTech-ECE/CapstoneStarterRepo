## [Signoffs](https://github.com/cebttu/CapstoneTeam1/tree/main/Documentation/Signoffs)
- Detail Designs are stored here. These include the functionality, constraints, buildable, analysis, and the BOM of each subsystem. Approved signoffs are included in the main branch in their own folder. Direct links to each subsystem are below.
  	- [Chassis]()
  	- [Start Sensor](https://github.com/cebttu/CapstoneTeam1/blob/main/Documentation/Signoffs/Start%20Sensor/Start_Sensor_Detail_Design.md)
	- [Box Sweep]()
 	- [Button Push]()
	- [Team Spirit]()
 	- [Navigation System]()
	- [Drive Train]()
	- [Main Controller]()
	- [Power System]()

## Final set of prints (final design artifacts)
- Coming in 2024


### [3D Models](https://github.com/cebttu/CapstoneTeam1/tree/main/Documentation/3D%20Models)
- The current 3D model is stored at the link above as a .stl file for viewing and printing, an additional blender file is included as that is our file type for our editor of choice. This editable blender shall be removed once the project exits the design phase. 


### [Wiring Schematics](https://github.com/cebttu/CapstoneTeam1/tree/main/Documentation/Electrical/Schematics)
- Each subsystem's schematics are split into its own folder.


#### [PCB files](https://github.com/cebttu/CapstoneTeam1/tree/main/Documentation/Electrical/PCB)
- Empty for now, will include gerber and source files once used.


## Final BOM
- Coming once Design phase is complete
- Pdf of BOM
- Excel BOM


## Datasheet 
- Coming in 2024
- Includes all the information necessary for other systems to interface with the project in the intended manner. Includes the power expectations, interfacing, and compliance.
- Includes the results from all experimentation and the interpretation of the results.
