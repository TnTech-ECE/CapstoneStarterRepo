# What should be in the documentation folder

## Final set of prints (final design artifacts)

All schematics and artifacts should be in an appropriate file type. 

### 3D Models

3D models should be stored in the proper file type to facilitate editing, viewing, and printing. The best filetype for this is .stl, so all 3d models should be pushed to the repo as stl files. Stl files can be converted to solidworks models or autocad 3d models as necessary, can be 3d printed easily, and are 3d viewable natively in github. File (Documentation/3D Models)

Every constructed system of the project must have a complete (buildable) 3d model schematic.


### Electrical Schematics

There are many softwares that facilitate electrical schematic layout and design. kiCad is a great option, however, it is fine to use a simple 2D line software like autocad. Regardless of which software the team chooses to use, all the source files must be included in the repo along with pdf versions of the schematics. File (Documentation/Electrical/Schematics/Sources)

Every electrical system must have a complete (buildable) pdf circuit schematic. File (Documentation/Electrical/Schematics)


#### PCB files

The comments regarding electrical design apply here as well. kiCad is a great option and works well with the kiCad schematics. However, any software chosen by the team to design the necessary PCBs will be acceptable. All source files should be included in the repo. File (Documentation/Electrical/PCB/Sources)

Along with the source files, a complete set of gerber files for each PCB must also be included in the repo. These should be included in a folder called gerber files. File (Documentation/Electrical/PCB)


## Final BOM

The final version of the BOM should be uploaded as a pdf output of the excel BOM file. The excel BOM file should also be included.


## Datasheet 

This must give all the information necessary for other systems to interface with your project in the intended manner. This must include the power expectations, interfacing, and compliance.
	
This must also include the results from all experimentation and the interpretation of the results.
  
  
  
  
## The project poster

Include the project poster


## Detailed photos of the project

Include a folder of a set of detailed photos of the project. File (Documentation/Images)


## Any additional documents that are appropriate to include

If there are additional items that are important to understanding and working on or with the project, include them as well.
