## Discussion Notes
Progress on Minimal Functionality (MF)
- Meredith
   - Dr. Austen approved all specs for Camera Software MF
   - Further work on getting camera to auto-snap photos
- Abe
   - Dr. Austen approved all specs for Website MF
   - Further work on website reliability and data from receiver system
- Sterling
   - Dr. Austen approved all but two specs for Receiver MF
      - Testing requires drone with working Remote ID, our drone may not have one, legacy model pre-FAA law
      - OpenDroneID application for mobile phones, useful to test
   - Further work on two requirements and filtering packets
- Aaron
   - Dr. Austen approved all specs for Camera Hardware MF
   - Further work on camera operation and testing with Austin’s power system
- JieJun
   - Dr. Austen approved all specs for Database MF
   - Further work on organizing incoming Remote ID data and drone image files
- Austin
   - Dr. Austen approved all specs for Camera Power MF
   - Dr Austen approved all specs for Receiver Power MF with the condition of retesting the solar cells on a sunny day.
   - Further work on testing power systems and ensuring reliability.
        - “How?”

Experimental Testing
- 10 data points from entire system
- Test applicable constraints and standards for compliance
- Focus on critical areas of systems (Camera movement and image capture, receiver
consistency, etc.)
Lessons Learned Presentations
- Submit to Github when completed

Sidenotes
- Stargazing: Area ~1.5 hrs north, very dark and great for sky imaging
- Dr. Austen typically gone around 6-6:30pm, testing needs to be done by then for him to
view it
