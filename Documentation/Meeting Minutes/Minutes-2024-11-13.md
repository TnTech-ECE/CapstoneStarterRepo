   - Austin Williams

## Progress Updates
#### Meredith Nye
Completed the requirements for the camera software system minimal functionality
#### Abe Perkins
#### Sterling Sloan
Receiver transmits a signal to the database. 
#### Aaron Stewart
Completed the requirements for the camera hardware system minimal functionality
#### JieJun Stowell
Completed the requirements for the database system minimal functionality
#### Austin Williams
Completed requirements for both power systems minimal functionality.

## Planned Tasks
#### Meredith Nye
Finish the code as laid out in the initial design signoff.
#### Abe Perkins
#### Sterling Sloan
Have receiver pick up RID signal to finish minimal functionality. 
#### Aaron Stewart
Begin experimental analysis of subsystem, test system with power feed
#### JieJun Stowell
Test contraint for experimental analysis of database.
#### Austin Williams
Connect power systems to receiver and camera systems then perform experimental analysis testing.

## Discussion Notes
Progress on Minimal Functionality (MF)
- Meredith
   - Dr. Austen approved all specs for Camera Software MF
   - Further work on getting camera to auto-snap photos
- Abe
   - Dr. Austen approved all specs for Website MF
   - Further work on website reliability and data from receiver system
- Sterling
   - Dr. Austen approved all but two specs for Receiver MF
      - Testing requires drone with working Remote ID, our drone may not have one, legacy model pre-FAA law
      - OpenDroneID application for mobile phones, useful to test
   - Further work on two requirements and filtering packets
- Aaron
   - Dr. Austen approved all specs for Camera Hardware MF
   - Further work on camera operation and testing with Austin’s power system
- JieJun
   - Dr. Austen approved all specs for Database MF
   - Further work on organizing incoming Remote ID data and drone image files
- Austin
   - Dr. Austen approved all specs for Camera Power MF
   - Dr Austen approved all specs for Receiver Power MF with the condition of retesting the solar cells on a sunny day.
   - Further work on testing power systems and ensuring reliability.
        - “How?”

Experimental Testing
- 10 data points from entire system
- Test applicable constraints and standards for compliance
- Focus on critical areas of systems (Camera movement and image capture, receiver
consistency, etc.)
Lessons Learned Presentations
- Submit to Github when completed

Sidenotes
- Stargazing: Area ~1.5 hrs north, very dark and great for sky imaging
- Dr. Austen typically gone around 6-6:30pm, testing needs to be done by then for him to
view it
