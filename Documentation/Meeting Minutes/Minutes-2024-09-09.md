## Discussion Notes
- Change the room number for Brown 208 for the outlook meetings
- JieJun question
    - Raspberry Pi will be used to host the server
        - Place at the end of the design section
    - Constraint 
        - Restrictions
        - Must accomplish functionality
    - Analysis
        - Trying to prove that the design will satisfy the constraints
    - Ex.
        - Active filter
        - Passband is x frequency range… max power consumption is 1/4 W
        - Design is a circuit diagram 
        - Analysis is this design going to satisfy the constraints
            - Maybe use components tolerance
    - Computer type system analysis 
        - Runtime, is the CPU powerful enough
        - Enough memory, nonvolatile storage, network bandwidth
        - Deep dive: Software validation methods (Beyond scope) 
        - Could verify that the math is giving the correct results if applicable
- Design/ Analysis 
    - What’s the best realistic way to tackle fudge factors like weather data
        - Look at number of cloudy days in a row
        - Less thorough: three cloudy days in a row then show that the system would work
        - In reality, we have a probabilistic answer
        - Based on weather statistics we have a 99% probability for the system having enough power to operate
            - Go back and determine rather that is acceptable
        - Do the constraints give a specification on the system functioning on a particular day
            - Probably not
            - What do you actually design for?
                - Make a reasonable assumption and write it down
- Testing
    - Contrive different cases
        - Discharge the battery then shadow or not shadow the solar cell then gather the data
- Cost benefit analysis is important
    - Is the reliability crucial or can we tolerate certain outages
    - This is up to the customer
- Camera Hardware 
    - Protection for the camera 
        - Half dome design vs camera has built in protection 
        - Since the servos are water resistant, would protecting the wires and electrical components be enough
            - Different weather elements like rain, snow, ice, be fine temporarily or would they possibly damage the system?
                -  Make a reasonable decision of a cost / performance trade for the system
- Dr. Austen will have some time this afternoon and tomorrow morning to look at signoffs.
## Upcoming Deadlines
