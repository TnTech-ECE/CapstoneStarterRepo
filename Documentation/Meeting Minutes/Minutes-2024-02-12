Attendance: Conor, Caz, Adrin, Callie, Liam, Zac, Roberts, Colby, Stephen, and James

IEEE attendance reminder for MEs 
-No

Riding down arrangements tbd

$10 for 3 minutes on our board
-or tip jar
-keep comp officials out
-maybe not say donation

Give specs to MEs

How to deal with motor noise
-0.1 ceramic capacitor

look at push button and box sweep
-Roberts to check after meeting

Power to be taken care of tonight

Team Spirit 
-How will it work
-How will it tun on
-How will it turn on and off (Blink)
-How do you know the current
-How can you prove that the MOSFETs will survive
    -How do you know you are in Spec or not?
    -WHat are you pulling
    -Was that in the Simulation -Current
    -Show Current so we know that it is not pulling too much. 
    -Doesn't have to be pulse source
    -Show in graph too Voltage output and Current

Prooving Motors will work with simulation
-Motors used in past Projects, make sure they are good. 
-Estrapulation graph looks similar to ours\

Previous SECON folders
-2023 is best for viewing sign offs
-2022 and before a bit CRAY CRAY
-Do lots of digging
  -May have more than 1 layer 
  -Almost worked

THANK GOSH FOR SUPER SIMPLE COMPETITION THIS YEAR

Conor to put prototype randomly in Github
If we get button working start sensor working

Arduino code for each person
-writing seudo code for each
-Going to have each person do their own
-Each be tested rather than everything all at once
-VOID???
-Void is like main

Latch system should be relatively easy to mount
-Will get diminsions when comes in
-James has pictures of design in CAD
-Roberts said either way of spring will be fine

Every picture of course is different 
-Nav can direct before and after crater
-Wrong measurements on Files
-Discord
  -No one knows what is going on in Competition Discord
  -Fire fire fire panick fire
-More concerned about Nav line than anything
-2nd white line after crater would be nice for team spirit, if not, it is all good
-2 inch paint rolller rather than 4in
-Chassis is ordered and Start Sensor
-MEs have a way to help with verifying friction ??
  -If we ran into friction issues
    -Could print out of TPU
    -Different Geometry or same
    -TPU is more grippy
    -Hot glue to help????
    -Add weight???
    -Spray on shoe to help?
    -Is it a boat instead of a car? and was it FLEXSEAL????
-Failing Mechanically
  -Arm and Friction is biggest concern
    
  -Current tracks are engineering plastic but removable

-order BOM for buttom push to be ordered, possibly tonight??

Anything from ME's?
-is box sweep going to interfere with button push
    -MEs make surface
    -Cervo below platform
    -Sprint to finish
    -GO GO GO 
    -BUtton push activated after crater
    -Box sweep closes at corner
    -Robot to box, not box to robot
    -Serious concerns about placement for box sweep and button push

Not messing with Fuel Thrushers or Zipline
  -Goal is repetatability
  -Hardware get extra 10 points for that
  -Chat GBT make power point?????

Back for box sweep instead of front
If small boxes can fit under robot
  -can robot run them over easily?
Shield for robot if rub up against side
  -back right edge to add roller to help from rubbing edge
  -Paint roller or dead wheel to help
  -Wheel to prevents us to get track to wall contact
  -Roller barring
  -accept that we will grind on the wall
  -3d print skate wheels
  -bracket and Roller
    -Not too big wink
Julie Mountain will email us back when parts are in



MEs:
Part to be ordered
throw box sweep
look into traction
