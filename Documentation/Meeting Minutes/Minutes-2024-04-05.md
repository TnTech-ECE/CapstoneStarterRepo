## Progress Updates
#### Meredith Nye
Completed the storage drive analysis and constraints for the receiver system. Made changes to the project proposal based on feedback from Dr. Austen.   
#### Abe Perkins
Worked on the Bill of Materials for the receiver subsystem detail design. Assisted with making decisions pertaining to SDR/antenna selection and subsystem location.
#### Sterling Sloan

## Planned Tasks
#### Meredith Nye
Submit meeting minutes, make changes to contraints on the reciever system based on meeting feedback, complete the camera software subsystem detailed design. Add Dr.Austen into the github. 
#### Abe Perkins
Complete website subsystem detail design document and create pull request. Assist others with their respective detail designs and revise project proposal.

## Discussion Notes
Need to add Dr. Austen to the github for pull request authorization
- Changes to good-faith design
o Need to add more metrics and proof of concept for the final version
o Ensure that all methods are justifiable and usable for the project
 Weed out all alt-solutions
- All subsystems will have a good-faith entry by Wednesday, April 10
- Initial Feedback:
o Why “Design Constraint” for source?
 Maybe change the wording here
 RID signal band comes directly from standardized documentation
 Add FCC source
o “Shall only unpack and read data from the RID signal”
 Be careful with using “Only” here, will lock us into a corner
 Reword sentence to say “shall only utilize RID signals and ignore any
other signals”
o “Shall store the data for 90 days”
 Modify to “store the data for no more than 90 days”
o “Shall receive data from RID emitting drones”
 Obvious, but good to write
 “Shall receive all RID emitting drones
o “Shall track drones on the contiguous TTU campus”
 If it flies from out-of-bounds, enters our airspace, then retreats back to off
campus?
 RID will give the location of the pilot
 Re-word to account for this scenario
 If it detects a drone flight outside of the bounds, should you store
in case they enter campus airspace?
o “Shall receive signals from a minimum radius of 600 meters”
 Need good evidence to justify this one
 How to justify this?
 Tied to two things:
o Reception distance
o Reciever placement
 Bluetooth and Wifi have a standard for receptive sensitivity
o From signal strength and receptibility, find effective range
of sensor
 Also need to look into the module method for proper elimination
o Start looking into testing criteria for our detail design items
- Documentation for Aircraft tracking system
o Raspberry Pi + Servos
o Ensure weather resistance
 Birds ruined that one
Other Things
- Seminar about Drone RID
o Thursday, April 11 2024
 1900 CST (7pm)
 https://www.faasafety.gov/SPANS/.....
- Continue working on project proposal revision
o Clarification on subsystem feedback
 We found multiple systems
 Keep the scope down to Remote ID Sensing systems for major
consideration. Mention the others, but mark them as out-of-scope.
 Continue beefing up background and standards
 Beef up measures of success
 Make sure its measurable, feasible, and prove-able in court
(industry standard)
 Assign numbers to success definition
- We will let Dr. Austen know when we are ready to have our systems reviewed
o Don’t close issue until you’re SURE that the criteria have been met
