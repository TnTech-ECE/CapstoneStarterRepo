## Discussion Notes
- Sensor Transciever Review
   - Up to 20 Million Samples per second
      - This is the Nyquist Rate
      - Will limit our capabilities for RTI
      - Frequency Conversion -> Quadrature Sampling
   - Is there something cheaper?
- Concept Design
   - Change the name of the “Sensor” subsystem to “Transceiver.”
      - Used to transmit and receive signals in the same frequency band
         - More of a Receiver + Transmitter
         - Change to “Receiver” instead of “Transceiver”
- Detail Design
   - Finish one subsystem as a team, then continue independently
      - Once designed, certain things are set in stone
         - Consider:
            - Which one should you choose so that you don’t lock out other systems
            - If you don’t know power requirements, you wont have anything to design
               - Hit this one last
            - Defining interfaces first
               - Crosstalk, Analog or Digital comms
   - Detail Design Requirements:
      - How to verify coding subsystems?
         - Website, Camera control program, Database
            - Algorithmic State Diagram
         - Function Specification
            - Psuedo-code
            - Test cases, then write code
               - Ensure validation
               - Watch for side-effects
      - Need Flowcharts, Build Schematics
      - For everything:
         - Look for off-the-shelf product first to save time and money
            - Design as last-resort
            - For enclosure, look for box with NEMA certification
      - Consider and rule out other options before committing to one specific choice
         - Consider reliability, cost, limiters/constraints
- Project Proposal
   - Feedback sent back, issues with one team preventing further progress
      - Wait I guess.
