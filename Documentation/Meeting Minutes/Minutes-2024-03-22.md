## Discussion Notes
Sensor Transciever Review
- Up to 20 Million Samples per second
o This is the Nyquist Rate
o Will limit our capabilities for RTI
o Frequency Conversion -> Quadrature Sampling
- Is there something cheaper?
Concept Design
- Change the name of the “Sensor” subsystem to “Transceiver.”
o Used to transmit and receive signals in the same frequency band
 More of a Receiver + Transmitter
 Change to “Receiver” instead of “Transceiver”
Detail Design
- Finish one subsystem as a team, then continue independently
o Once designed, certain things are set in stone
 Consider:
 Which one should you choose so that you don’t lock out other systems
 If you don’t know power requirements, you wont have anything to
design
o Hit this one last
 Defining interfaces first
o Crosstalk, Analog or Digital comms
- Detail Design Requirements:
o How to verify coding subsystems?
 Website, Camera control program, Database
 Algorithmic State Diagram
 Function Specification
 Psuedo-code
 Test cases, then write code
o Ensure validation
o Watch for side-effects
o Need Flowcharts, Build Schematics
o For everything:
 Look for off-the-shelf product first to save time and money
 Design as last-resort
 For enclosure, look for box with NEMA certification
o Consider and rule out other options before committing to one specific choice
 Consider reliability, cost, limiters/constraints
Project Proposal
- Feedback sent back, issues with Jroberts preventing further progress
o Wait I guess.
