Discussions:
  1. Detail Design
     a. For the power system, one entrance/exit to the Engineering Quad parking lot needs to use a combination of solar and battery.
         The other entrance/exit to the Engineering Quad parking lot needs to use a combination of a 120 VAC, 60 Hz wall outlet and battery.
    b. Any objects that are on a device being used and affects how it works must be added to the detail design with explanation of how it works.

Decisions:
  1. Have Detail Design for Ground Based Sensor Subsystem complete by Oct. 25th at 9 pm for signoff.
