## Discussion Notes
- Dr. Austen sent constraints email and asked Jesse Roberts about it to confirm.
    - Helps to clear up the constraints
        - In terms of mandatory optional, do this or not that, defining limitations
        - Comes with some examples 
            - Must do this but may do that
- GitHub link for Abe confusion
    - Pull request may not be updating 
    - Blob is the branch that it is on
    - Make sure that the proper thing is displayed on the pull request
        - If approved it then goes to the main branch
- Dr. Austen question
    - What’s transmitted from RID
        - FAA website says location about drone and control station for standard
        - Broadcast model has info about drone and takeoff location
            - Ensure to document the differences in data
- Roberts mentioned LoRa for communications as an alternative (For Receiver)
    - Consider that as something to look into
    - Avoids dealing with campus network
    - Engineering design decision for which way you want to go
- Send him an email and specify if you want him to look at the full thing or functionality and constraints
- Can work over summer if you want and he will answer emails slowly over summer
- We’ll figure out a schedule for meetings next semester 


- Abe 
    - Functionality
        - The database system instead of our
        - Remove at a speed that will allow
            - Say that it will check and speed can go into a constraint
            - Check for information in real time then time separate is a constraint
        - Delete last sentence about not working if others don’t work
    - Constraints
        - Comments that go along with the constraints 
            - Those are justification so real time justification should probably be in the constraints (Numbers will be in the constraints)
        - Number three should be split 
            - Concise display in real time and security should be separated 
        - How do you notify them
            - Popup through the website
        - Notify and display in real time
        - Concise data display
            - UI easy to use
        - Security is another thing
        - Specific timeframe for specific drones
        - May remove private from the alert urgency
            - Designated geographical location makes it more generic 
        - Sounds good with those modifications
        - Is anything missing
            - May show authorized drone (User could turn this feature on and off)
                - Could merge this with authorized drone constraint
                - User interface will provide an option to display or hide those from the map
            - Any standards that could be implemented for the website
                - W3.org
                    - HTML standard can be found here
                    - Auxiliary standards could go along with that
                    - If you add validator to the start of that link it shows you if that site meets standards
                    - If it passes the validator it should work for all browsers
            - Does he need anything about hardware?
                - You can self host the website
                    - Can run on your own engine
                - Abe and JieJun’s website can be run on the same system but someone should be accountable for hardware
    - Looking Ahead with Testing
        - How will he test these and demonstrate that the constraint was met
        - Pull up website
        - Test real time with a drone
        - Can you quantify concise
            - Get a user ideally police dispatcher with some small training to get user testing
        - Security
            - Hard to test
            - Crock in Prescott 
                - Sounds like a Pokemon
                - See if they can crack it 
            - Maybe a checklist or list of best practices
            - Think about how to test it to a reasonable degree (Can never have 100%)
                - What’s cost-benefit tradeoff
            - A lot of bases can be covered with basic stuff
        - Standards
            - Validator for W3
        - Authorizing drones
            - Test with a drone example
    - Justification
        - Add privacy and safety


- JieJun 
    - Plan to host SQL database on a Raspberry Pi
    - Functionality
        - Remote ID data packet wording
        - Receive data and store it in the database needs to be added
        - Where is the filtering for the camera tracking
            - he will be the one that filters authorized vs unauthorized
        - Provides database access to the website subsystem
    - Constraints
        - First one is a design decision not a constraint ( Moved further down to how the system works)
        - Complete data pull request from website 
            - When user clicks on website link data request will be fulfilled
            - Wording needs to be fixed
        - Third 
            - Split into two parts
                - Receive information from website about authorized flights and store
                - When receiving a drone signal check it against the authorized list
            - Some drones may have a blanket authorization or may be time constrained
            - Website is just an interface
        - Four
            - Ties in with number three ( Closely related )
        - Five 
            - Ties in with number three (Closely related )
        - Anything about data retention or data you don’t want to store
            - Only store data from RID or image
            - Will store for at least 90 days (TTU Policy)
                - Could turn into a constraint or be left generic for a user-specified amount of time
                    - Goes back to security 
                    - If storing 20 years worth of data someone can steal 20 years of data
            - The collated data in the database introduces a privacy issue (can be unexpected)
                - Data security is important 
        - Hardware is missing as mentioned before
        - Camera health alert can be sent from camera could mention it in the functionality
            - Will be a good constraint
            - Good idea to have an alert system
        - Think about how to test each of these constraints
        - The writing needs improvement to help with grammar and proofreading 
        - How to deal with optional stuff from RID?
            - If optional stuff  is anything useful to store?
            - Decide what is relevant and not
                - Probably filter out a lot of stuff that way

- Aaron
    - Functionality
        - He is responsible for the design of
        - Camera Hardware system will capture images of UAS and send them to the database ( no use for campus police )
        - Add that the camera will be able to move (Steerable camera)
    - Contraints
        - Get rid of capable of; it shall capture an image
        - Database will be storing the image not him
        - Resolution and format is specified
        - Servo motors
            - Range of accuracy was way too ambitious 
            - Justify that number in the analysis
            - With a field of view what pointing accuracy do you need
                - 30 degree field of 10% is still pretty good
                    - Not mathematical but a good rough idea
                - Pointing accuracy is a function of the field of view
                - From that you can derive an angular requirement for pointing accuracy
                    - Keep object you’re viewing to keep within 25% of the frame.
                - Ties in with Meredith’s tracking
        - Response time of servo motors 
            - Look at what typical systems achieve
                - In justification find three systems that achieve that performance so that’s what we will shoot for
                - Or do analysis 
        - Using existing standard for weather requirements
            - Give brief summary that they’re good for outdoor exposed and wet environments
        - Don’t say anything about field of view
            - Currently using a variable field of view 20-60 degrees
            - Could that be a constraint based off location
                - If wanting to be user-adjustable specify that
                    - Make sure to clarify that the FOV is only manually adjusted by a physical modification at time of installation
        - Don’t worry about locking it up since it will not be accessible 
        - Box 
            - The lease will need to see through the box and point
            - Think about the physical setup
            - Could be problematic
            - Outdoor security camera may be a good thing to research
            - Box may contain some of the stuff then the rest be outside of it.
        - Constraint that deals with power
            - Voltages, tolerances, maximum …
                - Applicable for any hardware subsystem 
        - Interface
            - Who is taking care of the communications
            - Hardware provides the means then software does it
            - Have some spec on communicating 
                - All three need to agree on the mechanism of communication
        - Protocol could be another constraint
            - Larger system design would define the protocol well designed
                - System level design question 
                - Acceptable to differ that until later in the design
            - Make this a vague constraint
                - Communicate with database subsystem by a mutually agreed communication link and protocol 
                - Link is hardware, protocol is software
        - Limitation of low light
            - Modification of number one
            - Footnote would justify it 
        - Don’t need to repeat obstruction thing
            - Could modify one to say collect an image of whatever you’re pointing at
                - Better 
            - Direction part would go in servo motor section
        - Time and pointing might be combined into a single constraint
        - Health status 
            - Power input, servo, wifi, something else, 
            - What kind of problems can be detected 
                - If you don’t hear anything from camera subsystem you might think it died. Might add that to communication protocol between database and camera
                - Monitor motor currents? 
            - Watchdog is a hardware reset
                - Database can see notification of a restart 
                    - If you see a sequence then it may be a problem
            - Need a way to sense the problem 
                - What can we detect 
                - Gears strip on servo if running too long
            - Will the health bit be practical?
        - Testing
            - Protractor and pulses
            - Did it move fast enough
        - Which constraint is standards
            - Needs to be added
        - What is png 
            - Likely a png standard
        - IPX6 NEMA4X6 are standards
        - Make use as long as they fit
