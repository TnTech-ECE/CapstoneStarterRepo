Discussions
  1. Discussion over Project Proposal and the issues in the Project Proposal.
  2. Discussion over Conceptual Design: No need for subsystem dedicated to sign updates as it is a small task that can be done in addition to the main subsystems.

Decisions
  1. Meeting on 09/30/2023 for Team 6 members to revise Project Proposal and complete subsystem development for Conceptual Design
  2. Meeting will also involve working on Conceptual Design.
