## Discussion Notes
- Kickoff Meeting
  - Attending: All members, Dr. Austen, Dr. Roberts
- Expectations
   - Austin: Supervisor and Customer
     - Customer – Drones repeatedly causing issues and nuisances on campus, unsafe and potentially dangerous
       - Restrict monitoring zone to main campus
          - Easier to create more later
       - Remote ID used to track both drone and user
         - Consolidate data and provide real-time information
         - Also accessible in real time
       - Assuming drones are transmitting trackable IDs – ignore otherwise
         - Currently only seen in REGISTERED drones
         - <250g Drones are not required to be regulated, therefore may not transmit the IDs
         - Investigate 2-Party Consent Laws
      - Needs to be able to differentiate between approved and non-approved drones, avoid false alarms
         - Potentially add a registration process to be added to a list of approved flights for student fliers.
      - How to keep records?
         - Keep timer on airspace duration, pathing, ID, etc.
            - Police will be end-all be-all say on data archiving
            - Generate mapping of drone traveling during the year
            - Good access to storage facilities for the data
         - Find good areas to set up tracking network
            - Wi-Fi Deadzones, add transmission
            - Difficult-to reach areas or hide in plain-sight
         - Cool Idea
            - Take a picture of the offending drone when it is detected
               - Certain stations, not every listener
               - Can be implemented in shoot-down technology
                  - Already implemented in Airplane project
               - Drone take-down is out of scope
                  - Unfortunate
   - Speak to Campus Police for insight into end-usage desires
      - User Interface, accessible via cell-phone
      - Meet Early on
   - Speak to IT IF network if it requires
      - VPN set-up to make safer
      - Linux-based, avoids Licensing
- Costs
   - Department willing to finance
      - Roberts – Budget is flexible only this year for capstone project for reachable projects
         - Come up with a preliminary cost, Roberts approves/denies
- Testing
   - Approved, registered drone to test with
      - Abe’s Roommate able to source drone
- Maintenance
   - Develop plan for long-time support without engineers
      - Long-Time Battery / Solar System Array
      - Easy to understand systems to be troubleshoot-able
         - Security Updates, Wiring diagrams, Accessibility, Operating Systems
- Supervisor
   - Weekly Meetings
      - Set up regular meeting schedules
         - Tentative – 2pm Fridays
         - Tentative – BROWN 208
      - Send out a calendar invite for everyone involved
   - Limited assistance from Dr. Austen
      - Options, pointers, advice
         - No design assistance
   - Design sign-offs and approvals
- Requirements
   - Power, Data Manipulation, Communications and Signals
   - Everyone must have one major subsystem
      - Additional Ideas and features can always be added
      - WHAT needs to be done
   - Add Extensions to Proposal
      - IEEE Flexible Platform - Wireless Power
         - Good example of extensions
   - Aim to finish designs before end of semester
- Follow-Up
   - Remote ID Research
   - Speak to campus people for specs
   - Austin Mornings busy, Afternoons free
