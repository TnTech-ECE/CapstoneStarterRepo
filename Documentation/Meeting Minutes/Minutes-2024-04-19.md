## Discussion Notes
- Dr Austen has a couple things
    - Summer we can email him if we want to work on things
    - He is now on the GitHub
    - For emails, make sure the subject line is appropriate 
        - Class number or drone project
        - Use “DroneProj - Subject line “ ( IMPORTANT)
            - This will let him sort by capstone emails
    - With Pull request you want to nail the restraints then work on the design details
        - He is going to glance at design first but focus on restraints
    - Camera Software
        - Shall not account for light levels and obstructions 
            - More of an exception not a constraint
            - Add that to the end of the most relevant constraint
            - Merge 1 with another constraint
            - Low-light levels is fuzzy 
                - Would be nice to have a measurable threshold for too dark
                - Think about specifying a camera (could be camera hardware specific)
                - Option: Camera has its own light source (Flash or spotlight) so we could say that is not being implemented
                    - Some cameras are better for low-light situations 
                - Need a usable threshold for what light level is too bad
                - Potential that software could deal with exposure and iris controls of the camera
        - 2 is good
            - If not will capture user of UAS 
        - 3 is a limitation 
            - Will also output camera motor controls
            - Will be sent the relevant information from the RID package 
                - Location of UAS, altitude of UAS, UAS speed, UAS direction of flight
                - Optional Data: Control station, flight beginning location ( I missed some stuff to shut the window) 
                - Given that and knowing the camera location Meredith figures out where to point the camera, so she turns that into a constraint 
                - Shall compute camera pointing angles based off of list of data from RID
                    - Then have a general constraint for both hardware and software of capturing a picture excluding limitations. 
                - Constraints about outputs driven from hardware
                    - Accuracy of computation, 
                - What kind of commands will be sent to the motors 
                    - Will be sent an absolute angle to turn to (accuracy of that output 1 degree, 5 degrees, etc. depending on analysis)
        - Meredith: Difference between functionality and constraint?
            - He may be mixing functionality and constraints
            - Dr. Austen: What is the system expected to do?
            - Constraint could include limitations now 
            - Constraint might be that you follow an industrial standard, or weather resistant, low maintenance, 
            - System is tested based off constraints in semester two
            - Constraint could be what it has to do or not to do 
            - Constraint about pointing accuracy, information received is latitude longitude etc.,  (Inputs will be in this form and subsystem will be designed to satisfy that) 
            - Try to identify if a person is into an image (Increases complexity with image processing) 
            - Plane tracking group did some image processing to check if an airplane was in the image then track that (That made it a bit easier to track since position data only gets so close)
            - JA: How large of a field of view do we want?
                - How much can we zoom in and still be confident to capture an image of the person and environment.
                - When to prioritize the picture of the drone or the control station?
                    - Would want a pic of drone for evidence if its outside a dorm room
        - If you specify an angular accuracy that can be translated to accuracy of the pulse width, so the constraint should be specified based on angle.
            - Relates back to FOV of the camera lens 
            - Something towards a mile telephoto lens 
        - Initial image data transfer
            - Why not just stick to a raw file?
            - Might say it will be this format or that format
                - One or two standard formats that are easy to handle 
        - Tracking
            - Does Meredith want to do prediction based off time lag to try to point the camera to where the drone is right now?
                - Could be computed based on time delay assumptions
                - May not be needed if FOV is wide
                - Code could adjust for parameters? (Didn’t hear all that)
            - Predict drones position taking account delay and processing time (delay is a parameter entered later on)
                - Constraint is only valid if drone is moving in a straight line 
            - Predict motion provided that its in a straight line
                - Arcs could be predicted ( Could be difficult so probably not a good idea)
            - Could you predict based off velocity, process time, and direction 
                - How could get velocity from one point
        - Analysis: 
            - Present some math for the computations
                - Nasty trig ewww
        - Constraint on what the software will be executing on
            - Needs to operate on Arduino class microprocessor or supercomputer 
            - What processor will be needed 
            - Computational complexity, and rate ( times per second computations are required which will be once per second from RID)
                - How often will pulses be sent to camera to keep motors moving 
                    - Example sample rate 1mil samples/sec x 500 multiplications per sample so we need cpu capable of running at that speed (Get a rough order of magnitude)
- Conceptual Design Peer Review is due today
- Functionality and constraints are the main priority
- Database:
    - How much data do we need to store
        - Not much so its not worth storing on ITs server
        - RID and pictures
        - Dominant data storage is the images 
        - Figure out how much 
        - Storage issues should be easily solvable 
        - Security is a big concern with IT so stay away from them if possible
- Website:
    - It’ll be easier to host our own server 
        - IT is paranoid for breaking into our systems unless we need extreme performance
