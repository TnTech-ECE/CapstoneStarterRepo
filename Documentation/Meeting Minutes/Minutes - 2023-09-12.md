## Meeting Minutes

Advisor Meeting:

The team went over the proposal document with Dr. Chen.

Too much information in background, probably more suited to the conceptual design document

Conceptual design has block diagram of subsystems w/ inputs and outputs, what kinds of sensors are needed for that subsystem's functions, etc.

Will we have multiple microcontrollers? This will affect integration. 

More existing solution and relevant literature

Block diagram would be helpful to show subsystems

Criterion for selecting sensors

What location resolution does the customer want?

location precision can be a measure of success

Add more numbers to measures of success

Goal to send the proposal draft to Dr. Chen by Thursday, Friday at the latest

Team Meeting:

Team went over the proposal document and decided to start with a blank LaTeX document with section headers and put in what we are sure about.

## Action Items for Next Meeting

Do more work on the proposal document
