## Discussion Notes
- Protection subsystem
   - Coverage
   - 3D â€“ Modeling
   - Enclosure protections
   - Likely going to be a collective item, not an individual subsystem
- Website
   - Large amount of work for one person
      - Dependent on the functionality
      - Front-End + Back End
   - Front-End
      - Looking nice comparable to Tech Banner and Eagle Online
      - Potentially add complicated systems to make more complex
   - Hard to see how to split the system into two items
- Cameras
   - Use potentially Wide Angle Lense(s) to see the drone instead of tracking it
      - Analyze:
         - Resolution
         - Distance
         - Zoom capabilities
      - Look for one singular spot for a camera
         - Look for drone hotspots
         - Keep in mind that stadium is going to come down at some point
            - Keep camera in-range of stadium, but outside of construction zones
         - Try to also account for pilots being in vicinity
            - If pilot coordinates are In renage, snap them instead?
   - Camera Array
      - Relocatable
      - Two network systems: Camera and Data Feeds
      - Wireless Power
      - Privacy concerns:
         - Camera locations
   - Camera Master + Camera Array
      - One nice camera + Many lower-quality cameras
         - Place nice one in the hotspot, one in the not-spot(s)
   - Make cameras movable with heat map
- Conceptual Design
   - Fully Formulated Problem
   - Fully Decomposed Conceptual Solution
   - Constraints and Origin
      - Minimize Risks
      - Addressing Subsystems, stakeholders, etc
   - Constraint validation (Analytical)
      - Validate approach and methods for solution
   - Detailed Design Schedule
