## Discussion Notes
- Protection subsystem

o Coverage

o 3D – Modeling

o Enclosure protections

o Likely going to be a collective item, not an individual subsystem

- Website

o Large amount of work for one person

§ Dependent on the functionality

§ Front-End + Back End

o Front-End

§ Looking nice comparable to Tech Banner and Eagle Online

§ Potentially add complicated systems to make more complex

o Hard to see how to split the system into two items

- Cameras

o Use potentially Wide Angle Lense(s) to see the drone instead of tracking it

§ Analyze:

· Resolution

· Distance

· Zoom capabilities

§ Look for one singular spot for a camera

· Look for drone hotspots

· Keep in mind that stadium is going to come down at some point

o Keep camera in-range of stadium, but outside of construction zones

· Try to also account for pilots being in vicinity

o If pilot coordinates are In renage, snap them instead?

o Camera Array

§ Relocatable

§ Two network systems: Camera and Data Feeds

§ Wireless Power

§ Privacy concerns:

· Camera locations

o Camera Master + Camera Array

§ One nice camera + Many lower-quality cameras

· Place nice one in the hotspot, one in the not-spot(s)

o Make cameras movable with heat map

- Conceptual Design

o Fully Formulated Problem

o Fully Decomposed Conceptual Solution

o Constraints and Origin

§ Minimize Risks

§ Addressing Subsystems, stakeholders, etc

o Constraint validation (Analytical)

§ Validate approach and methods for solution

·

o Detailed Design Schedule
