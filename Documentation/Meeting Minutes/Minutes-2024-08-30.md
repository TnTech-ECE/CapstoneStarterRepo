## Discussion Notes
- Next weeks meeting time and date
    - Wednesday is probably the best time after capstone lets out
    - 3:30 - 4:30
    - Send out an outlook invite
- Clarification on my sign off with grades being individual now
- Feedback on the signoffs was given last semester
    - Quickly address the feedback
    - Let him know via email when we are ready to look at the GitHub again
    - Don’t wait since the due date is coming soon
- Dr. Austen has classes at
    - MWF 9 and 11
    - TR 3 -5
    - Other times are good times to find him in the office
    - Check the Telecom lab if we can’t find him in the office
    - Send an email to find a time
- Meredith question on feedback (Camera software)
    - Math about straight line motion analysis / predicting a point
        - He said she should move that to buildable schematic not the analysis
    - She is confused where to start with analysis
        - Those equations are theory and the foundation for the design
        - He wants those equations in design
        - Analysis
            - You have a design and prove that it will work
            - Circuit use LTspice for example
            - Power system show that it meets requirements
            - Software 
                - The software design is fuzzy for Capstone
                - Run a couple examples using the equations and draw it out
                    - Shows that the equations will give working results
                    - Check examples running into limits with the servos or other components
            - Taking the design and showing with reasonable confidence that the design will work
            - Sterling’s system example
                - Present reference or link equations above
                - Analysis run the numbers through the equations and verify that the minimum threshold is met
                - You could also use tolerances to get a very accurate simulation to show that the design will work even if the components are on the edge of the tolerance range
- Micah Rentschler is trying to follow in Jesse’s footsteps for the most part for the course
- Power 
    - General design that may need to be modified if changes are made with Aaron and Sterling’s design changes
    - Generally see only 2-4 voltages within a system
    - Workaround for avoiding many different voltages
        - A system could have a regulator to modify the voltage
    - Voltages should be designed at the system level ideally not end up in the situation with the deadline we are facing now. 
    - Potential future improvement you would have lots of interconnection details figured out beforehand 
    - Systems are located in different locations
- Software interfaces will be discussed at some point 
- Mention where the system is physically located to clear up the interconnections
## Upcoming Deadlines
9/16/24 - Complete Detailed Design Signoffs
