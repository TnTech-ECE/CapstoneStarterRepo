## Discussion Notes
- Meredith now has the Raspberry Pi 4 from Dr. Austen
    - 16 GB SD card is inside
    - Install whatever distribution is needed.
    - Keyboard monitors and mice are in the capstone lab to plug it into
- Sterling and I need to complete our BOM
    - Receivers are independent so we will only need one set for each system
    - Only need the components not protection
    - Will determine minimal functionality first 
    - Only order one copy for each power system and the receiver system
    - Going to try to get that finished tonight
- Camera Hardware and Network system are approved for BOM
- Minimum functionality
    - Will be written in a formal form
    - Each subsystem creates a list
    - Each item on the list must be testable 
        - Think about how to prove how it can be tested to prove that it was achieved
    - Receiver
        - Picks up a signal
        - Minimal processing
        - Packaging it 
        - Sending it out
        - Could show two things
            - Receive a signal, display that it was received
            - Send it out
    - Power
        - Vary the current 
        - Minimum and maximum loads
        - Check the maximum current to see that it functions under worst case
        - Simulate a load
        - Electronic load equipment to set it to draw certain amounts of current
            - Mcdermin Lab (Spelling?)
            - May have one in the capstone lab
            - Basically a variable resistor to draw the programmed current 
        - Show that it works at typical currents, so we may not need to test all the limits
    - Receiver
        - Separate Receiving and transmission
        - Show that the receiver can identify that there is an RID signal
        - Wants it to receive something, donâ€™t need to go from the extreme end of the range
        - Where will we receive the signal
            - Borrow one of the RID drones and get it to transmit a signal
        - Transmission
            - Make sure it sends to a laptop or something
            - Get a message out to another device
        - Website
            - Pull data from a database
            - Letting a user select a specific drone and pull up details
            - Authorization 
            - User interface tasks
            - Display data on a map
            - Can come up with simulated data to display
        - Database
            - Receive a simulated package 
            - Eventually show that we get it from the receiver
            - Receive, Create, and retrieve database records
            - Package data to send commands to the camera software
            - Geographic tests for restricted locations
        - Camera Hardware
            - Verify that power is proper
                - Power consumption is secondary
            - Make sure the servo motors can handle the camera and nimble
            - Cable clearances
                - Secondary
            - Raspberry Pi heat dissipation
            - Communications are working 
            - Images are good quality, size, and focus
                - Capturing a picture and storing it is significant 
            - Servos can track drone within the picture
                - Important to follow and track the drone
        - Camera Software
            - Execute code in the correct order
                - Secondary
            - Communicate with the database to receive and send information
            - Sound internal calculations 
            - Output the correct signal to move the motors correctly
            - Detect an internal error 
                - Check for power
                - Low voltage error simulation
            - Calculating the correct pointing angle and correct PWM for the servos are most important
            - Getting the camera pointing in the correct direction is the major thing
    - Give a short write up for minimal functionality and how we are going to show success
        - What will the observer see to prove that the system does what it claims
- Safety training is almost finished
- Network connection
    - Need to have good specs in order for the network connection
    - Wireless may allow us to avoid some of the issues brought by IT
    - Need to look into if going wireless is feasible
    - Going through ITS will be an unnecessary delay at this point
    - We can work around by not having a DNS entry wirelessly 
    - Device will have to be told the IP address of the server
    - This method will help us avoid delay from IT issues
    - They may be able to set up a VPN for us
        - Worth investigation
    - Initially getting it working wirelessly will make it easier.
- We will ask for the expectation for the format of Minimal functionality
- Testing documentation
    - Statistics for the testing?
    - Look ahead for what we need to document and we can anticipate that when testing
- Think about what we need for the poster
    - Think about the audience
    - Students touring
    - Converting MEs
    - Be sure to explain the problem well
