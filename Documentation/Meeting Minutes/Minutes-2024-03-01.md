## Discussion Notes
- Conceptual Design
   - What not how is very important
      - Input output specified
      - Think about the information that needs to be transferred for your interfaces
      - We might do it this way or that way
         - Don’t want to constrain yourself
      - Don’t box yourself in before you have to
      - May have to negotiate on interface methods
         - One method may be hard for one subsystem but easy for another
      - We want to detail our shall statements more
         - Real time -> The actual speed
            - Think about how the user will use our system
               - 5 minutes obviously too long
                 - How much delay is reasonable
                    - What is great, good, okay, and absolute minimum.
            - How fast can the drone and pilot move
               - Tie that to how fast we transmit information
                    - It is important to justify any decision we make
      - We could do multiple diagrams if needed
      - Camera
         - How fast does it need to pan and tilt
            - Issue with airport project
               - Servo spec and pulse width is too specific at this point
      - A2D not and unpack/pack not needed at this point in the block diagram
      - Website box to user connecting
      - Get someone random to look at our diagram to see if they can make sense of the diagram.
         - Can help address problems
