## Ideas Synopsis

Resistor Sorter

- Idea to put resistors into a rotating wheel where each resistor would fall into the measuring
ramp
    * This would be in steps and would remove the issue of mixed-up resistors
    * A person would need to put in the different resistors
- Idea to put resistors in a feeder and it would drop into a system like the previous idea
- For the last step of the sorting, idea to use a circular dish to place the sorted resistor into the bin
- Issue is that people may still be more involved in the process
- Issue of the resistors being bent and clogging the process

SUAS Competition

- Possibly not being able to compete if we get to that point (mid to late June)

Secon Robot

- Deadline would be earlier (March 20-24)

## Current Project Ideas

1. Resistor Sorter
2. Sensing, nav, control mec. Wheeled robot (A)
3. Flex and safe power platform for robots with wireless charging (B)
4. SUAS Competition
5. Smart automated traffic light using infrared sensor
6. SECON Robot

## Voting on project in anonymous ranking in form

- Winner: 2
- Ranked: 2, 3, 5, 4, 6, 1

- By doing project 2, we want to make sure that it can work without wireless charging, so we do
not rely too much on another group

## Working on Contract

- Designating Tuesdays at 1pm as our recurring meeting time
    * Abigail send calendar reminder for everyone
- Leads voted on: Mabel Olson and Abigail Kennedy
- Meeting at 1pm on Friday, August 25 to finalize contract and will host Teams for people who cannot attend
