# Database - Experimental Analysis
## Experiment Description
### Summary
Taking potential interference into account, the database must reliably receive drone packets from the receiver system regardless of its location on campus. Furthermore, when handling a drone packet of maximum byte size, the system's processing time must remain within the defined time limit.

#### Subsystem(s) Involved:
- Database Subsystem
  
- Camera Subsystem

#### Constraints Tested:
- Constraints 1 - If a drone enter a pre-marked geographical locations, then the drone location, drone speed and control station location will be sent to the camera subsystem.
- Constraints 2 -  The system shall support data transfer over the network.
 
#### Expected Result(s):
- Constraints 1 - Considering the maximum byte size of the drone packet, the system should detect a drone entering a predefined geographical location within 100 milliseconds.
- Constraints 2 - The database will be capable of receiving a packet from a receiver situated in a separate building.

## Experimental Procedure
<!-- Description of what you did ideally in steps -->
### constraints 1
- (more detail is describe in [Methods for testing constraint 1](#Methods-for-testing-constraint-1): 
1. Generate a packet with a maximum size of 250 bytes, plus a 9-byte header.
2. Send the drone packet.
3. Develop a method to calculate the total processing time once a packet is received.
4. Monitor and evaluate the overall time taken to process the data.

### Constraints 2
- Number of trials: 2
1. Relocate to a site different from where the database is installed.
2. Send the drone packet to the database located in the Capstone Lab
3. Use [upload speed tester](https://www.speedtest.net/result/17036840573) to check for upload speed, ideally we want the upload speed to be low as possible
4. Monitor and analyze the database to check for any missing data.

As outlined in the F3411-22a document, a packet can contain up to 10 message block (one block used for id), with a total size of 250 bytes (the remaining space filled with filler data). The example message above will be used to test both constraints, with messages 2 and 3 in the packet designated for validating the priority zone.

The figure above show the priority zone area selected.

#### Methods for testing constraint 1
- Method 1:
1. Only Example Message 2 will be included within the 259-byte packet.
2. Message 2 will be placed in the 10th block.
3. If the processing time exceeds 100ms, move Message 2 to the 5th block.
4. If the processing time is close to 100ms, move Message 2 down by one block (from block 5 to 6) until the processing time exceeds 100ms.

- Method 2:
1. Both Message 2 and Message 3 will be included within the 259-byte packet.
2. Message 2 will be placed in the 6th block, while Message 3 will be placed in the 10th block.
3. If the processing time exceeds 100ms, move Message 3 to the 6th block.
4. If the processing time still exceeds 100ms, shift both Message 2 and Message 3 up by one block (from block 6 to 5), and continue shifting until the processing time is less than 100ms.

- Method 3:
1. fill a full pecket with with every drone location detecetd inside the priority zone.

## Conclusions
#### Interpretation of Data
<!-- explain what the results of the experiments mean and what conclusions you draw -->
Based on Constraint 1, three different methods were employed to test a maximum-byte packet when a drone is detected within the priority zone. If the drone is detected in the last block, it results in the longest processing time for transmitting the drone's location data to the camera system. However, in Method 3, when the drone was detected across all nine blocks during the first run, the processing time remained below 100ms. In the second run, after reaching the sixth block, the processing time exceeded 100ms.

Upon reviewing the main code, the issue appears to stem from how the system interacts with the database. Whenever a drone is detected within the priority zone, the system attempts to connect to the database, retrieve the required data, and then close the connection. If the system could maintain an active connection for a specified timeframe after the initial connection, it would likely reduce the processing time to below 100ms.

In Constraint 2, two locations were selected for testing. Both locations demonstrated upload speeds significantly higher than the size of the maximum-byte packet. As long as there is a stable Wi-Fi connection with an upload speed exceeding 259 bps, the database should be capable of receiving and unpacking the packet in under a second. This is supported by the fact that the Raspberry Pi hosting the database in the Capstone Lab achieves a download speed of approximately 39 Mbps.

#### Final Thoughts
<!-- Were constraints met? -->
Both constraints were met, except for Constraint 1 when using Method 3. However, upon reviewing and analyzing the issue, there is certainly room for improvement.
