# Testing Priority Constraints
## Experiment Description
### Summary
Insert Summary here

#### Subsystem(s) Involved:
Camera Hardware Subsystem

#### Constraints Tested:
- System shall capture an image of the UAS in flight or the control station
- Images captured by the system shall be transmitted to the database in either a RAW or PNG format with a minimum resolution of 1080px720p
- Servo motors shall be capable of reaching and maintaining angles required for image capture with a ± 10° range of accuracy<!-- - Servo motors shall be capable of reaching required angles in a minimum time of 500 milliseconds after recieving the appropriate signal(s) -->
- Camera system shall not draw more than 50 Watts of power
 
#### Expected Result(s):
- Image of Drone or Operator to be taken and stored
- A PNG or Raw Image type present in either the database or the computer running the database
- An angle set by the running software to be met by the servo within a ± 10° range of accuracy (set 70. get anywhere from 60-80)<!-- - Servos reach the set angle within half a second -->
- In all states, system draws well below 50 Watts of power
