# Power Systems - Experimental Analysis
## Experiment Description

For the power systems, the most important experiment is to measure the voltages and currents with the actual loads 
to find the power instead of the simulation used in the minimal function prototype stage. For both experiments, the voltage and current
was measured.

<br/>


The purpose of the two tests was to calculate the power with the actual loads connected under typical operating modes 
to ensure that the power systems will supply adequate power for the Camera and Receiver subsystems to acheive their full functionality
without limitations due to insufficient power. 

<br/>


For the Power Camera system, a voltmeter and ammeter were connected while the Camera Hardware system interfaced with the Camera Software,
Website, and Database systems to make various movements with both motors. We measured 20 individual turns of the motor to gather a
sufficient amount of data. 

<br/>


For the Power Receiver system, the team used a USB test meter to measure the voltage and current supplied from the Waveshare module
while the receiver system ran the CHANGE THIS program.
