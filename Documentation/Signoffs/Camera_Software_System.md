# Camera Software System
## Functionality
The camera software system will be reponsible for controlling the camera hardware system, ensuring that the system is able to accurately take an image of an UAS in-flight or the UAS pilot and save it to the database for usage by campus police.
## Constraints
| No.| Contraint | Origin |
| -- | --------- |--------|
|  1 | Shall reliably capture an image of an UAS in-flight or the UAS pilot | Project Proposal |   |  2 |           |        |                          
|  3 |           |        |              

<sup>1</sup> Reliably capturing an image of the unauthorized UAS will assist the Tech Police in regulating Tech Policy 190 [^1].

<sup>2</sup> Reason for contraint 2 and why it is important

<sup>3</sup> Reason for contraint 3 and why it is important
