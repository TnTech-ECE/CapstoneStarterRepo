# Camera Software System
## Functionality 
The camera software system will be reponsible for using the data acquired by the receiver to generate signals that will control the camera hardware system's motor servos and camera activation status, ensuring that the system is able to take an image of an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) or the control station. The system will then acquire the image from the camera hardware, format it, and sent it to the database for usage by campus police. The system will also send an alert signal if there are detected errors in the system.    
## Constraints
| No.| Contraint | Origin |
| -- | --------- |--------|
|  1 | The system is not expected to capture an image of the UAS or control station if light levels and/or obstructions hinder the camera's view of the UAS or control station. | Stakeholder Constraint | 
|  2 | If the system receives data for the control station location, the system shall prioritize capturing a picture of the control station unless the corresponding UAS is in a high alert area as defined by the Tech Police. In that case, the system will prioritize capturing a picture of the UAS. | Tech Police |
|  3 | Location prediction shall be performed when the UAS or control station is moving in a straight line, but is not required if the UAS or control station is moving in other trajectory. | Design Constraint |
|  4 | The system shall use at least three data points to determine if the UAS or control station is moving in a straight line within a 5% error margin. | Design Constraint |
|  5 | The system shall output the picture taken to the database as either a raw file or PNG. | Design Constraint | 
|  6 | The system shall communicate with the database system according to IEEE standard 802.11 [^3] and Tennessee Tech Policy 856 [^4] | Standards |

<sup>1</sup> The stakeholders for the project did not specify that the camera system must always capture an image of the unauthorized UAS or UAS user in 100% of pictures taken by the system because the most important information, as specified by the Tech Police, is the information contained in the RID signal and not the image captured. Therefore, the system will be not be constrained to determining the visibility of the UAS based on environmental factors before taking a picture, and cannot be held responsible for these factors obstructing the view of the UAS in pictures.

<sup>2</sup> The Tech Police prefer a picture of the UAS control station over a picture of the UAS unless the UAS enters a high alert area. The Tech Police will be able to specify the location of high alert areas through the [website](Website_System.md). 

<sup>3</sup> Any motion other than straight line motion will be either too complex or impossible to predict. 

<sup>4</sup> Two data points alone do not provide enough information to accurately determine the motion of the UAS or control station. 

<sup>5</sup> Raw files and PNGs will help to maintain the quality of the image captured. 

<sup>6</sup> IEEE standards help to decrease internet traffic and ensure appropriate data transfer rates. Tennessee Tech standards ensure that different security levels of data are appropriately protected.   

## Flowchart and Coding Details
<img src= "/Documentation/Images/Camera_Software_System/Flowchart.png" width="600" height="1000">

### Flowchart breakdown
<img src= "/Documentation/Images/Camera_Software_System/Parsed1.png" width="250" height="150">

Following [constraint 2](#Constraints), the code will allow a UAS in a high alert area to take precedence over a control station location, but will attempt pictures of a control station if a UAS is not flying in a high alert area. This section of the flowchart also addresses the unlikely scenario where the data received from the [Database System](Database_System.md) is incomplete or insufficient. If there is not enough data to take a picture, the software will not waste time analyzing the data and will instead wait to receive complete data before proceeding past this point. 

<img src= "/Documentation/Images/Camera_Software_System/Parsed2.png" width="125" height="105">
This block will contain code that is only concerned with two factors:

1. Is the UAS or control station close enough to the camera to take a quality picture?
  
2. Does the system need to take another picture?

The first factor will utilize the minimum quality picture distance data from the [Camera Hardware System](Camera_Hardware_System.md) detailed design markdown file and the difference between the camera location and UAS or control station location. When the UAS or control station is too far away from the camera location, a picture should not be taken. 

The second factor will utilize how recent the last picture was taken and the location of the UAS or control station. If a picture was taken under 1 second ago (as that is the maximum time between RID transmissions[^1]) and the location of the UAS or control station is identical to the previous picture location then another picture should not be taken. This factor is an attempt to decrease the number of redundant pictures sent to the database.

<img src= "/Documentation/Images/Camera_Software_System/Parsed3.png" width="175" height="125">

This block contains code that will be associated with [constraint 4](#Constraints). The code will determine if the UAS or control station is moving in a straight line over a span of at least 3 points and will attempt to predict the next position if straight line motion was detected. This prediction as well as the average time delay of the system, and the UAS or control station velocity will be used to alter the camera pointing angles as needed. See the [associated section](#Predicting-UAS-or-Control-Station-Location) for mathematical calculations.  

<img src= "/Documentation/Images/Camera_Software_System/Parsed4.png" width="130" height="150">

The camera pointing angles will be calculated using the UAS or control station location and the location of the camera. See the [associated section](#Camera-Positioning) for mathematical calculations. After calculating the camera pointing angles, the code will instruct the motors to move as close to the pointing angles as the [hardware](Camera_Hardware_System.md) will allow. Then, the system will take a picture and send it to the database as a raw file or PNG according to [constraint 5](#Constraints). 

<img src= "/Documentation/Images/Camera_Software_System/Parsed5revised.png" width="130" height="130">

The code located in this block will utilize all available sensors or software feedback mechanisms to determine whether the system needs to send an alert to the Tech Police. 

### Coding Language
The microprocessor that will run the software is defined in the [Camera Hardware system](Camera_Hardware_System.md), and it is compatible with multiple different coding languages. Due to programmer's preference, either C++ or Python will be used.

### Camera Positioning
#### Horizontal Pointing Angle
<img src= "/Documentation/Images/Camera_Software_System/angle1.png" width="300" height="200">

$\ x = \textrm{UAS longitude}-\textrm{Camera longitude} $

$\ y = \textrm{UAS latitude}-\textrm{Camera latitude} $

$\ \theta_1 = \tan^{-1} (\frac{y}{x}) $

$\ \textrm{If x is a negative number: } \theta_1 = \theta_1 + 180 \degree $

#### Vertical Pointing Angle
<img src= "/Documentation/Images/Camera_Software_System/angle2.png" width="300" height="200">

$\ z = \textrm{UAS altitude}-\textrm{Camera altitude} $

$\ l = \sqrt{x^2+y^2} $

$\ \theta_2 = \tan^{-1} (\frac{z}{l}) $


### Predicting UAS or Control Station Location
#### Determining Straight Line Motion
Given 3 points:

$\ p_1 = (x_1 , y_1, z_1), p_2 = (x_2 , y_2, z_2), p_3 = (x_3 , y_3, z_3) $

The two directional vectors are:

$\ \overrightarrow{P_1P_2} = (x_1 - x_2, y_1 - y_2, z_1 - z_2) $

$\ \overrightarrow{P_2P_3} = (x_2 - x_3, y_2 - y_3, z_2 - z_3) $


And their magnitudes:

$\ |\overrightarrow{P_1P_2}| = \sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2+(y_1 - y_2)^2+(z_1 - z_2)^2} $

$\ |\overrightarrow{P_2P_3}| = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_3)^2+(y_2 - y_3)^2+(z_2 - z_3)^2} $


If equations 1, 2, and 3, below are all true, straight line motion exists within 5% error margines. 

1.
$\ (\frac{x_1-x_2}{|\overrightarrow{P_1P_2}|} * .95) \leq \frac{x_2-x_3}{|\overrightarrow{P_2P_3}|} \leq (\frac{x_1-x_2}{|\overrightarrow{P_1P_2}|} * 1.05) $ 

2.
$\ (\frac{y_1-y_2}{|\overrightarrow{P_1P_2}|} * .95) \leq \frac{y_2-y_3}{|\overrightarrow{P_2P_3}|} \leq (\frac{y_1-y_2}{|\overrightarrow{P_1P_2}|} * 1.05) $ 

3.
$\ (\frac{z_1-z_2}{|\overrightarrow{P_1P_2}|} * .95) \leq \frac{z_2-z_3}{|\overrightarrow{P_2P_3}|} \leq (\frac{z_1-z_2}{|\overrightarrow{P_1P_2}|} * 1.05) $ 


#### Predicting Future Location
Given straight line motion, and the velocities:

$\ v_2 = \textrm{velocity value at point } p_2 $

$\ v_3 = \textrm{velocity value at point } p_3 $

Let the predicted location of the UAS or control station be 
$\ (x_p , y_p, z_p) $ 
where:

$\ x_p = x_3 + ((\frac{v_3}{v_2}) * (x_3 - x_2)) $

$\ y_p = y_3 + ((\frac{v_3}{v_2}) * (y_3 - y_2)) $

$\ z_p = z_3 + ((\frac{v_3}{v_2}) * (z_3 - z_2)) $

## Analysis
### Proving Camera Pointing Angle Accuracy
  Utilizing the 3D plot function of MATLAB, a simulation of a target in flight and a camera were created. The Figure below shows this simulation where the blue line represents the path of the target, the black circle represents the location of the camera, the yellow circles on the blue path line represent the point in space that the camera is attempting to point to and the dotted lines representing the camera vectors which visually help make it clear that in theory the math is capable of orienting the camera towards the target given its x, y, and z coordinates. The path of the target was chosen arbitrarily with the only requirement being that it traveled in all quadrants around the camera. The location of the camera was also specifically chosen to not lie at the origin to ensure a degree of realism. The MATLAB code and figures are as follows:

<img src= "/Documentation/Images/Camera_Software_System/Pointing angles matlab graph.png" width="500" height="400">

<img src= "/Documentation/Images/Camera_Software_System/Pointing angles matlab graph xy.png" width="500" height="400">

<img src= "/Documentation/Images/Camera_Software_System/Pointing angles matlab graph yz.png" width="500" height="400">

The MATLAB code analyzes the simulated path of the target, uses the derived [equations](#Camera-Positioning) to calculate the pointing angles. Then, utilizing only those pointing angles, the code reverse engineers the point on the path that the camera will be focussing on and the vector from the camera to that point for intervals along the target's path.

end

l = sqrt((xp.^2)+(yp.^2));
theta_2 = atand(tp./l);

r = sqrt((xp.^2)+(yp.^2)+(tp.^2));

    end

    if m == 0
        yl = ones([1 1001]).*cy;
    end

    if n == 0
        zl = ones([1 1001]).*cz;
