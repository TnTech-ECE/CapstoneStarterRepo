# Launcher Housing
## Functionality 
The launcher housing will provide power to the other subsystems connected to the main interceptor body, provide a functional E-Stop button, have a lighting system, and have a firing alarm. The power system will be made up of two power supplies, two low level 5 V 2 channel relays, 5 power distribution blocks, and a latching twist to turn on push button. Lighting will be done with two 1 meter long LED strips in purple and gold colors. A 12 V buzzer will be used for the firing alarm.  
## Constraints 

* C5: Include a clearly marked power switch on the interceptor.
    * In order to verify this constraint is met the interceptor must have a switch or switches that turn the interceptor on and off when flipped. 
* C6: Include a clearly marked emergency stop option on the interceptor.  
    * To verify this constraint is met the interceptor must have a labeled E-Stop that will prevent power from flowing to all non essential components of the interceptor when pressed. 
* C10: Design an interceptor with lights that are visible when powered on.   
    * The customer asked for decorative lighting that serves no purpose other than aesthetics. 
* C12: Design an interceptor which plays an alert noise before firing. The noise played must be louder than 50 dB when within a 10 foot radius of the interceptor. 
     * The customer asked for an alert to be played before the interceptor fired. A sound 50 dB or louder when within 10 feet of the device was chosen as 40 dB is typical room noise and privatized alarms are required to be at least 10 dB louder than that [12] [13].  
* C24: Housing will provide 30W of filtered power to the processor and provide at least 300W to the alarm, lighting and motors. 
    * The selected values of power that the housing must provide are formulated from the maximum power draw of all subsystems on the main interceptor. The Raspberry Pi 5 requires power with little noise and has a maximum power draw of up to 30W. The motors have a combined power draw of 241.2W and the LEDs and buzzer have a combined power draw of 21.84W. As such 350W was selected to leave headroom.  

## Buildable Schematics
### Electrical Schematic 
![alt text](https://github.com/JTJones73/Capstone2024-Team2/blob/arwatson42-Signoff-Housing/Documentation/Signoffs/Housing_Schematic_Diagram_R2.png)
The electrical schematic shows the connections between the wall and the power supplies [1] and [2] via the switching extension cord [3]. The schematic then shows the configuration of the E-stop [4]. Connecting each of these to a bus enables the entire interceptor to be powered. The schematic also shows the connection between the Raspberry Pi 5, the relay [5], the LED strips [6] and [7], and the piezo buzzer [8]. The 12V power supply was chosen in order to provide adequate power for the steppers used in the aiming and firing sections while the 5V power supply was chosen in order to provide the raspberry pi with clean reliable power. The switching extension cord was chosen as it permits adequate current draw in addition to having switches which will sever as the interceptors power switches. The E-stop button was chosen in order to minimize potential points of failure within the E-Stop system by minimizing the amount of connections the E-Stop system will need. The low level 5V relay was chosen as it allows the processor to easily control both the buzzer and LED systems. The buzzer was chosen since it emits an adequate sound to alert bystanders while the two LED strips were selected due to the relatively low power draw they have while also being fairly close to the colors of the school. 

## Analysis

### Power Switch
The extension cord [3] selected to transfer power from the wall to the interceptor also contains two power switches. Due to being made of 16AWG and 18AWG wire the cord is able to conduct the rated current and voltage to supply power to the interceptor power supplies. As the switches in the cord are designed to switch loads on and off through that cord the switches will be sufficient to serve as power switches. Thus constraint 5 is met. 

### E-Stopvc
The E-Stop button requires a button capable of switching the power draw from the wall to the non processor power supply when used. The E-Stop button is placed after the power switches.The E-Stop button acts as the contact to keep the relays from opening. As the highest draw from the motors is 9.6A at 12V the selected relays can switch the loads to the motors. This means the relays and E-Stop button will meet the requirements of stopping the flow of power to the motors. The selected E-Stop also is clearly labeled which will fulfill the requirement that the button be clearly labeled in constraint 6. 

### LEDs 
The lighting of the interceptor only needs to be visible to observers. To verify that the purple LED strip will be visible in brighter environments the video on the information page was used. At timestamp 3:31 the video shows the LED with brighter ambient light against a brighter background. The color of the LEDs can still be seen. 

The gold LED strip also has a video on its page. This video shows the gold LED strip powered on in a bright department store at timestamp 7:57. The color of the LED strip can be clearly seen both from the camera facing the strip and the reflection of the light produced seen on the other camera. 

### Buzzer 
The selected buzzer has a volume output of 68 dB at 61 cm when supplied with 10V. This noise level will increase at 12V. Using the sound attenuation formula: 

$SPL_{2} = SPL_{1} - 20log(\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}})$ 

It can be found that a sound of 68 dB at 61 cm will be 54.03 dB from 10 feet away. As such the selected buzzer is loud enough to serve as the alarm for the interceptor. 
### Power system 
The power system analysis is broken into two sections to make it easier to understand what each portion provides power to. Each section provides justification for the power draw of the systems inside it. 
#### Raspberry Pi Power
The 5V 5.1A power supply [2] manufactured by raspberry pi was selected in order to provide noise free power to the Raspberry Pi 5. It will provide enough power to utilize all the features of the processor as it was designed specifically to power that unit. Additionally since it is not connected to the other power supply the Raspberry Pi will receive "clean" power. 

### 12V Power 
In order to provide power to the other subsystems on the main interceptor body a 12V 29A power supply was selected [1]. This power supply can provide up to 348W if needed. Due to the turntable motor driver requiring 12V and 4A a power supply of at least 48W is required to run the turntable motor. The firing motor operates on 12V and has a starting and stall current of 9A, as such a aditional 108W is required. The launch angle motor at worse case will draw up to 2A at 12V meaning another 24W is required. The power draw from the LED strips [6] and [7] is 9.6W per meter meaning to power the two LED strips at worse case will take 19.2W. The buzzer [8] has max current draw of 22mA meaning at 12 the power draw from the buzzer would be 2.64W.  This places the theoretical maximum power draw of the main interceptor body at 178W. As the 348W power supply was a similar price to models that supply power closer to the maximum power draw of the interceptor it was selected to ensure that there would be ample head room.
