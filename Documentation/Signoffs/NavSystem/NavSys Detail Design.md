## Function of the Subsystem

The Navigation System serves as the central control hub, responsible for directing the robot as it traverses its predefined course.
The navigation system will use an array of infrared sensors to detect the yellow line. These sensors output low on black and dark colors, and high on white and light colors. The array will output digital bits in an I2C format

## Buildable Schematic

The image below shows the sensor array that will be used in the construction of the navigation system. This sensor array was chosen over other models due to its inbuilt I2C conversion abilities. This makes using this module easier than using a non converting sensor array and having to convert the output from the array to I2C for the main controller. It is also cheaper than most of the other alternatives for converting to I2C format.

The following shows a numbered image of the sensor array. It is followed by a description of each number and its function.

| 1. | IR Brightness Control and Indicator | The potentiometer controls the strength of the IR LEDs, and the IR PWR LED shows that strength as a brightness level. The brighter the LED the more IR is emitted. |

The sensor array will be connected to the main controller in order to recieve power and transmit the I2C data from the sensor to the main controller. It needs between 25mA and 180mA to operate, depending on the distance from the surfacce it will be sensing. This sensor array will be operating at 100mA to ensure it can sense the surface without the sensor dragging on the ground during the robot's traversal of the course. The image below shows how the IR sensor array will be connected to the power supply for the robot. The following image shows how the sensor array is connected to the main controller. The main controller in this schematic is a stand in, as the precise controller has not yet been designed.

The following is a 3D model of where the sensor package will go on the robot. The sensor array is shown as the purple block on the underside of the robot chassis. The main controller is shown as the blue block, and the power system is the green block. The red wires are the main voltage supply, supplying 5 Volts to the sensor array, and the black wires are the ground connections. The yellow wire is the I2C data cable and the pink wire is the I2C clock data. The sensor array is bolted on to the chassis through the mounting holes on the sensor, as shown above in number 6.

The following image shows the mounting holes on the robot chassis and the sensor array. This view is from the underside of the robot. As shown, the sensor array is behind the slope of the tracks, preventing it from dragging on the slopes of the course.

## Analysis

Constraint 1 Solution: 

The array must have an operating wavelength between 1mm and 50um. The sensor used in this design has an adjustable operating wavelength that averages 940nm. This can be seen on page 3 of the datasheet.

Constraint 2 Solution:

The sensor array must have two sensors detecting the yellow line when it is centered. The yellow line is 1 inch in width and the array has sensors spaced 1/2 inch apart. This ensures that the center two sensors are detecting the yellow line simultaneously when the robot is centered on the line. This allows for the main controller to know when the robot has shifted off center and is able to make adjustments accordingly.

Constraint 3 Solution:

The senor must be smapled at a frewuency of at least 20Hz. The sensor array has a sampling frequency of 4kHz, ensurring that when the micro controller accesses it it will have refreshed and have new information avaliable. This can be seen on the installation guide provided with the sensor array. The 20 Hz is sufficient because the drive train will not be able to adjust the robots position quicker than that, so the microcontroller is not overloaded with data from the sensor.

Constraint 4 Solution:

The array must be able to read the yellow line on a black background. The array outputs a high signal on dark colors and a low signal on light colors. This allows for the sensor to output a low signal from the sensors that see the line and a high signal from those that do not. The micro controller can read this information to determine the robot's position above the line.

Constraint 5 Solution:

The array must be within 1/2 inch of the yellow line. In order for the sensor array to read the line it must be within 1/4 to 3/4 inches from the line it is detecting. Mounting the sensor array on th eunderside of the robot and ensuring the chassis has a mounting point with only a 1/2 inch of clearance allows for this constraint to be met. As shown in the figure below, the sensor array will be mounted 1/2 inch above the surface of the board.

Constraint 6 Solution:

The array must be able to detect the white perpidicular line at the start and end of the crater. This is accomplished becaues the entire array will output a low signal on the white colored line. Having all the sensors output low will signal the main controller that a white line has been reached.

Constraint 7 Solution:

The sensor must be in the center of the front of the chassis of the robot. This is to ensure that the robot stays centered over the yellow line whilst moving along the course. This is accomplised by having the sensor array 4 inches from each side of the robot chassis.
