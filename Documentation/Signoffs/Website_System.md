# Website_System
## Functionality
The purpose of the website subsystem is to allow a designated user to access the drone data stored in our database subsystem. The website will check the database for new information at a specific rate which will allow any new drones to be discovered by the police in as close to real time as possible. The accessed data will be displayed to the user in a clean, concise manner that allows for the timely, efficient management of dispatcher resources. The full functionality of this subsystem is subsequently reliant on the completion of all other subsystems.

## Constraints
| No.| Constraint | Origin |
| -- | --------- |--------|
|  1 | The database must be accessed through a website as opposed to a mobile phone application. | Campus Police |
|  2 | The system shall notify campus police in 'real-time' upon detection of a drone in flight. | Project Team |                          
|  3 | The data shall be displayed in 'real-time' and in a concise manner to a securely constructed website for campus police dispatchers         | Project Team / Campus Police |  
|  4 | The system shall allow campus police to authorize drones for permitted flights in a specified time frame. | Project Team |  
|  5 | The system shall increase the alert's urgency if a drone is detected in a private geographical region. | Project Team |
