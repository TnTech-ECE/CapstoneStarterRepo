# Receiver System 
## Functionality
The Receiver system will be responsible for receiving and unpacking Remote ID (RID) data to be sent by the network to the database.
## Constraints
| No.| Constraint | Origin |
| -- | --------- |--------|
|  1 | The receiver will only receive information within the frequency bands of 2.5 GHz and 5 GHz. | Design Constraint and Ethical Constraint|
|  2 |           |        |                          
|  3 |           |        |              

<sup>1</sup> FAA Policy 14 CFR § 89 [^1] and FCC Policy 47 CFR § 15 [^2]  <!-- I forgot what source was used to find the frequencies that the RID was transmitted through so I just put these -->

<sup>2</sup> Reason for constraint 2 and why it is important

<sup>3</sup> Reason for constraint 3 and why it is important
