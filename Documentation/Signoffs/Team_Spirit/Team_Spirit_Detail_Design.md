## Functionality

![Alt text](https://github.com/cebttu/CapstoneTeam1/blob/LiamCounasse-signoff-Team_Spirit/Documentation/Signoffs/Team_Spirit/spiritmech.png)

The purpose of the team spirit subsystem is to create a luminous and undeniable representation of TTU at the SECON robotics competition. It receives a signal and creates a display of purple and yellow blinking lights which are meant to represent Tennessee Tech University. 

The team spirit subsystem is nonoperational prior to entry of the thruster assembly zone. Upon entry into the thruster assembly zone the lights receive a signal and begin blinking. The lights remain on displaying a blinking pattern until the robot is powered off.

The competition requires that the team spirit display be dynamic and highly visible to represent the team and university. The perimeter of the robot is 44 inches. Each side of the robot is eleven inches. The led light will line the rear and side outer panels of the robot. The front will not be lined due to interference with the IR sensors of the navigation system. The team spirit system will utilize 2 circuits with one circuit of thirty-three purple LED lights with series resistances, and another circuit of thirty-three yellow LED lights with series resistances. These two strips of LED lights will be present at 1-inch increments around the robot. The series resistance provides the LEDs with overcurrent protection and prevents potential damage to the components. The gold strip will be placed above the purple strip on the siding of the robot. This system requires two digital inputs from the microcontroller of the main controller system. These digital inputs will control both strips creating the blinking pattern. The frequency of the blinking will be controlled by a function being looped outputting to each strip 2 times each second, or at a rate of 30 Hz. This can be done by utilizing delays between steps in the looped program.

Purple LED:

The purple LED is a 5mm round model with attached wires and a series resistance to protect the LED. The connected wiring and series resistances to the LEDs reduce the risk of a failure. The LEDs operate at 4 ~ 6 V+. 

Yellow LED:

The yellow LED is a 5mm round model with attached wires and a series resistance to protect the LED. The connected wiring and series resistances to the LEDs reduce the risk of a failure. The LEDs operate at 4 ~ 6  V+.

Figure 2: The circuit design of the LEDs in parallel with a series resistance of 510 â„¦ between the digital outputs and LEDs. It is connected to two digital outputs of the microcontroller for each strip, Purple LEDs, and Yellow LEDs. The common terminal of the LEDs is connected to the common terminal of the microcontroller.

## Analysis

Analysis:

Constraint Solutions:

Constraint 1 Solution:  

The team spirit subsystem shall be a highly visible representation of Tennessee Tech University. The team spirit system utilizes purple and yellow LEDs which blink and are present on the rear and sides of the robot. The luminous emission of the LED lights highly visible within the bounds of the course to represent the university. 

Constraint 2 Solution: 

The system shall be dynamic by displaying lights which blink at a frequency people can see. This restricts the lights to blinking at frequencies that are visibly turning on and off as a function of time. The imposed rule reducing the frequency of the signal as a function of time defines it as a dynamic system. The recommended frequency is less than 50 Hz because at 50 Hz blinking lights are perceived by people to be on.

Constraint 3 Solution:

The LEDs shall be spaced 1 inch apart in one-inch increments around the sidewall of the robot for a total length of 33 inches per color, or 66 inches of lights. The spacing and positioning of the LEDs prevents the components from getting damaged on a moving part of another system. The spacing and positioning around the sidewall of the robot allows for maximum visibility to shine lights for the team spirit display. The LEDs will be secured into placed in the frame of the robot by drilling through the border of the platform and securing the LEDs in the sockets which are individually secured 1 inch apart.

Constraint 4 Solution:

The LEDs shall extrude from holes 6mm in diameter 8.5mm apart vertically. Holes, 6mm in diameter, will be drilled through the chassis of the robot 8.5 mm apart and 8.5 mm from either edge to create positions which the LEDs can be embedded. These LEDs will then be connected properly and inserted in their proper extruded positions. This is a design specification for presentation purposes.

Constraint 5 Solution:

The LEDs shall be 8.5 mm from the top or bottom edge of the robot. This prevent potential damage to the edge of the frame while drilling holes to position the extruding LEDs. The holes will be drilled with centered positions marked 25 mm apart horozontally and 11.5 mm from the edge. The measurement for drilling 11.5 mm from either edge of the chassis side centeres the 6 mm drill bit on the designed location for the hole.

Constraint 6 Solution:

The Gold LEDs shall be installed above the purple LEDs on the sidewall of the robot. The gold LEDs will be installed in the extruding holes first creating the top row of lights. The second row of purple LEDs will then be installed into the extruding positions. These LEDs will be stored separately and tested prior to installaions to prevent accidents.

Constraint 7 Solution:

The LEDs shall be secured on the back, and side panels of the robot. The LEDs can safely be installed on the rear and side panels of the robot without the risk of interference with the sensors or movings parts of another system.The LEDs shall not be installed on the top, bottom, or on the front panel of the robot. The LEDs cannot be placed on the front of the robot due to potential intereference with the navegation system IR sensors.The LEDs cannot be placed on the bottom of the robot because the IR sensors are attatched under the front half of the robot.The LEDs cannot be on top of the robot due to the potential damage it can cause to the start recognition systems RGB sensor.

Constraint 8 Solution:

The LED lights shall not tamper with the IR sensors of the navegation system. The LED lights used in the team spirit subsystem emit purple and yellow blinking lights. These colored lights are reflected from the paint on the course to the IR sensors of the navegation system. These wavelengths of light tamper with the color of light which is being recieved by the IR sensors. This creates inconsistencies in the lines which would be percieved by the line following program. The solution to this issue is not placing the LED strips on the front of the robot. This prevents the light from refelcting onto the IR sensors. The LED lights being secured to the rear of the robot does not create issues with the IR sensors due to the angle of the emmitted light.
