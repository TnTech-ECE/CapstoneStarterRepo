# Camera Hardware System
## Functionality
The Camera Hardware system will be responsible for taking an image of a drone in-flight and saving it to the tracker database for usage by campus police.

## Constraints
| No.| Constraint | Origin |
| -- | --------- |--------|
|  1 | Shall reliably capture an image of a drone in-flight or the pilot | Project Proposal|             
|  2 | Shall capture a quality image of the drone from X meters away| Design Constraint|                          
|  3 | Shall limit image capture to once every X seconds to preserve data and avoid redundant photos| Design Constraint|
|  4 | Shall track drone across contiguous airspace using Remote ID location data | Design Constraint|
|  5 | Shall resist weather and external conditions to a reasonable degree| Project Supervisor|

<sup>1</sup> Capturing an image of the drone is a large part of evidence collection and can assist campus police in stopping unauthorized drone flight from repeat offenders

<sup>2</sup> Limiting image capture to a x meters ensures that images are sharp, clear, and properly utilize our data storage.

<sup>3</sup> Required to reduce redundant photos taking up space in the database

<sup>4</sup> Required to take a picture once drone is in range.

<sup>5</sup> To ensure reliability of system, environmental interference must be limited
