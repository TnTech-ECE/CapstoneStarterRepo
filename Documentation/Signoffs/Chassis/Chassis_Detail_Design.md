# Chassis Design

## Function of the Subsystem

The chassis serves as the foundational element upon which every system depends for dimensions and functionality. Ensuring adherence to competition guidelines in terms of length, width, height, and weight is vital to being able to participate in the competition. The motors and other electrical components included in this kit, will not be used as they will not perform sufficiently for this project. Thus, this design only considers the structure of this chassis kit.


## Constraints and Standards

| Number | Constraint Description | Origin |
|--------|------------------------|--------|
| 1. | The entire robot shall fit inside of 1 cubic foot. | Competition Specifications |
| 2. | The entire robot shall not weigh more than 25 lbs. | Competition Specifications |


## Buildable Schematic
Most of the listed dimensions of the Chassis kit from its various listings online were incorrect and virtually impossible given the dimensions of the mounting plate and how it was centered on the unit. Therefore, a 3D model was built and more appropriate dimensions were deduced from the mounting plate dimensions and track width.

## Analysis

Constraint 1 Solution:
<br />
As demonstrated by the 3D Model in Figures 4 and 5, the length, width, and height result in an area of 358.71 cubic inches (0.208 cubic ft.) This is significantly smaller than the 1 cubic ft requirement, leaving plenty of room for any other subsystems that may extend from the robot in any direction.

Constraint 2 Solution:
<br />
The weight listed for the Chassis kit is 1.1kg or 2.4251 lbs. This weight includes the DC Motors that will not be installed and will instead be replaced with different motors, as defined in the Drive Train Design. Even if the new DC Motors weigh more than those included in this kit, the chassis will weigh in at a very small fraction of the maximum weight restriction of 25 lbs, leaving plenty of leftover weight for the other subsystems to use.
